# VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures - Structure indicating support for scalar block layouts



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           scalarBlockLayout;
} VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures;
```

or the equivalent

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_scalar_block_layout
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeaturesEXT;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following feature:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.

## [](#_description)Description

- []()`scalarBlockLayout` indicates that the implementation supports the layout of resource blocks in shaders using [scalar alignment](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#interfaces-alignment-requirements).

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceScalarBlockLayoutFeatures-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SCALAR_BLOCK_LAYOUT_FEATURES`
