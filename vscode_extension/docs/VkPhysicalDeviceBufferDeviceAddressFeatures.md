## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures - Structure describing buffer address features that can be supported by an implementation



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           bufferDeviceAddress;
    VkBool32           bufferDeviceAddressCaptureReplay;
    VkBool32           bufferDeviceAddressMultiDevice;
} VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures;
```

or the equivalent

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_buffer_device_address
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeaturesKHR;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following features:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.

## [](#_description)Description

- []()`bufferDeviceAddress` indicates that the implementation supports accessing buffer memory in shaders as storage buffers via an address queried from [vkGetBufferDeviceAddress](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetBufferDeviceAddress.html).
- []()`bufferDeviceAddressCaptureReplay` indicates that the implementation supports saving and reusing buffer and device addresses, e.g. for trace capture and replay.
- []()`bufferDeviceAddressMultiDevice` indicates that the implementation supports the `bufferDeviceAddress` , `rayTracingPipeline` and `rayQuery` features for logical devices created with multiple physical devices. If this feature is not supported, buffer and acceleration structure addresses **must** not be queried on a logical device created with more than one physical device.

Note

`bufferDeviceAddressMultiDevice` exists to allow certain legacy platforms to be able to support `bufferDeviceAddress` without needing to support shared GPU virtual addresses for multi-device configurations.

See [vkGetBufferDeviceAddress](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetBufferDeviceAddress.html) for more information.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceBufferDeviceAddressFeatures-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_BUFFER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_FEATURES`
