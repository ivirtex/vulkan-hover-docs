## [](#_description)Description

Certain use cases for multiview have a need for specifying a separate viewport and scissor for each view, without using shader-based viewport indexing as introduced with `VK_EXT_shader_viewport_index_layer`.

This extension adds a new way to control ViewportIndex with multiview. When the [`multiviewPerViewViewports`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-multiviewPerViewViewports) feature is enabled and if the last pre-rasterization shader entry pointâ€™s interface does not use the `ViewportIndex` built-in decoration, then each view of a multiview render pass instance will use a viewport and scissor index equal to the `ViewIndex`.

## [](#_issues)Issues

1\) Is it possible to enable/disable the [`multiviewPerViewViewports`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-multiviewPerViewViewports) feature for individual render pass instances?

**RESOLVED**: No, when the multiviewPerViewViewports feature is enabled during vkCreateDevice, then all created render pass instances (including dynamic render passes from `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`) and all created VkPipelines will have the feature enabled. This approach was chosen because it simplifies application code and there is no known use case to enable/disable the feature for individual render passes or pipelines.

2\) When this extension is used, is the value of `ViewportIndex` implicitly written by the last pre-rasterization shader stage and can the value of `ViewportIndex` be read in the fragment shader?

**RESOLVED**: No, use of the extension does not add an implicit write to `ViewportIndex` in any shader stage, and additionally, the value of `ViewportIndex` in the fragment shader is undefined.
