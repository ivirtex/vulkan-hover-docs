# vkCmdDecompressMemoryIndirectCountNV(3) Manual Page

## Name

vkCmdDecompressMemoryIndirectCountNV - Indirect decompress data between memory regions



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

To decompress data between one or more memory regions by specifying decompression parameters indirectly in a buffer, call:

```c++
// Provided by VK_NV_memory_decompression
void vkCmdDecompressMemoryIndirectCountNV(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    VkDeviceAddress                             indirectCommandsAddress,
    VkDeviceAddress                             indirectCommandsCountAddress,
    uint32_t                                    stride);
```

## [](#_parameters)Parameters

- `commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded.
- `indirectCommandsAddress` is the device address containing decompression parameters laid out as an array of [VkDecompressMemoryRegionNV](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDecompressMemoryRegionNV.html) structures.
- `indirectCommandsCountAddress` is the device address containing the decompression count.
- `stride` is the byte stride between successive sets of decompression parameters located starting from `indirectCommandsAddress`.

## [](#_description)Description

Each region specified in `indirectCommandsAddress` is decompressed from the source to destination region based on the specified decompression method.

- [](#VUID-vkCmdDecompressMemoryIndirectCountNV-indirectCommandsCountAddress-07701)VUID-vkCmdDecompressMemoryIndirectCountNV-indirectCommandsCountAddress-07701  
  If the count stored in `indirectCommandsCountAddress` is equal to `1`, (`offset` + sizeof(`VkDecompressMemoryRegionNV`)) **must** be less than or equal to the size of the [VkBuffer](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkBuffer.html) that `indirectCommandsAddress` comes from
- [](#VUID-vkCmdDecompressMemoryIndirectCountNV-indirectCommandsCountAddress-07702)VUID-vkCmdDecompressMemoryIndirectCountNV-indirectCommandsCountAddress-07702  
  If the count stored in `indirectCommandsCountAddress` is greater than `1`, `indirectCommandsAddress` + sizeof(`VkDecompressMemoryRegionNV`) + (`stride` Ã— (count stored in `countBuffer` - 1)) **must** be less than or equal to the last valid address in the [VkBuffer](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkBuffer.html) that `indirectCommandsAddress` was created from
