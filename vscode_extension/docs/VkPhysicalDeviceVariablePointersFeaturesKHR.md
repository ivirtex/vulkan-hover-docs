## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures - Structure describing variable pointers features that can be supported by an implementation



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           variablePointersStorageBuffer;
    VkBool32           variablePointers;
} VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures;
```

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointerFeatures;
```

or the equivalent

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_variable_pointers
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeaturesKHR;
```

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_variable_pointers
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointerFeaturesKHR;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following features:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.

## [](#_description)Description

- []()`variablePointersStorageBuffer` specifies whether the implementation supports the SPIR-V `VariablePointersStorageBuffer` capability. When this feature is not enabled, shader modules **must** not declare the `SPV_KHR_variable_pointers` extension or the `VariablePointersStorageBuffer` capability.
- []()`variablePointers` specifies whether the implementation supports the SPIR-V `VariablePointers` capability. When this feature is not enabled, shader modules **must** not declare the `VariablePointers` capability.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures-variablePointers-01431)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures-variablePointers-01431  
  If `variablePointers` is enabled then `variablePointersStorageBuffer` **must** also be enabled

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceVariablePointersFeatures-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_VARIABLE_POINTERS_FEATURES`
