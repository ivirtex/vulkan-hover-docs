## [](#_description)Description

The `VK_KHR_win32_surface` extension is an instance extension. It provides a mechanism to create a [VkSurfaceKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkSurfaceKHR.html) object (defined by the `VK_KHR_surface` extension) that refers to a Win32 `HWND`, as well as a query to determine support for rendering to the windows desktop.

## [](#_issues)Issues

1\) Does Win32 need a way to query for compatibility between a particular physical device and a specific screen? Compatibility between a physical device and a window generally only depends on what screen the window is on. However, there is not an obvious way to identify a screen without already having a window on the screen.

**RESOLVED**: No. While it may be useful, there is not a clear way to do this on Win32. However, a method was added to query support for presenting to the windows desktop as a whole.

2\) If a native window object (`HWND`) is used by one graphics API, and then is later used by a different graphics API (one of which is Vulkan), can these uses interfere with each other?

**RESOLVED**: Yes.

Uses of a window object by multiple graphics APIs results in undefined behavior. Such behavior may succeed when using one Vulkan implementation but fail when using a different Vulkan implementation. Potential failures include:

- Creating then destroying a flip presentation model DXGI swapchain on a window object can prevent [vkCreateSwapchainKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCreateSwapchainKHR.html) from succeeding on the same window object.
- Creating then destroying a [VkSwapchainKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkSwapchainKHR.html) on a window object can prevent creation of a bitblt model DXGI swapchain on the same window object.
- Creating then destroying a [VkSwapchainKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkSwapchainKHR.html) on a window object can effectively `SetPixelFormat` to a different format than the format chosen by an OpenGL application.
- Creating then destroying a [VkSwapchainKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkSwapchainKHR.html) on a window object on one [VkPhysicalDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDevice.html) can prevent [vkCreateSwapchainKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCreateSwapchainKHR.html) from succeeding on the same window object, but on a different [VkPhysicalDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDevice.html) that is associated with a different Vulkan ICD.

In all cases the problem can be worked around by creating a new window object.

Technical details include:

- Creating a DXGI swapchain over a window object can alter the object for the remainder of its lifetime. The alteration persists even after the DXGI swapchain has been destroyed. This alteration can make it impossible for a conformant Vulkan implementation to create a [VkSwapchainKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkSwapchainKHR.html) over the same window object. Mention of this alteration can be found in the remarks section of the MSDN documentation for `DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT`.
- Calling GDI’s `SetPixelFormat` (needed by OpenGL’s WGL layer) on a window object alters the object for the remainder of its lifetime. The MSDN documentation for `SetPixelFormat` explains that a window object’s pixel format can be set only one time.
- Creating a [VkSwapchainKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkSwapchainKHR.html) over a window object can alter the object for its remaining lifetime. Either of the above alterations may occur as a side effect of [vkCreateSwapchainKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCreateSwapchainKHR.html).
