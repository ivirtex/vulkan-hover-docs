## Name

VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT - Import memory from a host pointer



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

To import memory from a host pointer, add a [VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT.html) structure to the `pNext` chain of the [VkMemoryAllocateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkMemoryAllocateInfo.html) structure. The `VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_external_memory_host
typedef struct VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT {
    VkStructureType                       sType;
    const void*                           pNext;
    VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBits    handleType;
    void*                                 pHostPointer;
} VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT;
```

## [](#_members)Members

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- `handleType` is a [VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBits](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkExternalMemoryHandleTypeFlagBits.html) value specifying the handle type.
- `pHostPointer` is the host pointer to import from.

## [](#_description)Description

Importing memory from a host pointer shares ownership of the memory between the host and the Vulkan implementation. The application **can** continue to access the memory through the host pointer but it is the applicationâ€™s responsibility to synchronize device and non-device access to the payload as defined in [Host Access to Device Memory Objects](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#memory-device-hostaccess).

Applications **can** import the same payload into multiple instances of Vulkan and multiple times into a given Vulkan instance. However, implementations **may** fail to import the same payload multiple times into a given physical device due to platform constraints.

Importing memory from a particular host pointer **may** not be possible due to additional platform-specific restrictions beyond the scope of this specification in which case the implementation **must** fail the memory import operation with the error code `VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE_KHR`.

Whether device memory objects imported from a host pointer hold a reference to their payload is undefined. As such, the application **must** ensure that the imported memory range remains valid and accessible for the lifetime of the imported memory object.

Implementations **may** support importing host pointers for memory types which are not host-visible. In this case, after a successful call to [vkAllocateMemory](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkAllocateMemory.html), the memory range imported from `pHostPointer` **must** not be accessed by the application until the [VkDeviceMemory](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceMemory.html) has been destroyed. Memory contents for the host memory becomes undefined on import, and is left undefined after the [VkDeviceMemory](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceMemory.html) has been destroyed. Applications **must** also not access host memory which is mapped to the same physical memory as `pHostPointer`, but mapped to a different host pointer while the [VkDeviceMemory](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceMemory.html) handle is valid. Implementations running on general-purpose operating systems **should** not support importing host pointers for memory types which are not host-visible.

Note

Using host pointers to back non-host visible allocations is a platform-specific use case, and applications should not attempt to do this unless instructed by the platform.

Valid Usage

  If `handleType` is not `0`, it **must** be supported for import, as reported in [VkExternalMemoryProperties](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkExternalMemoryProperties.html)
- [](#VUID-VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT-handleType-01748)VUID-VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT-handleType-01748  
  If `handleType` is not `0`, it **must** be `VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_HOST_ALLOCATION_BIT_EXT` or `VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_HOST_MAPPED_FOREIGN_MEMORY_BIT_EXT`
- [](#VUID-VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT-pHostPointer-01749)VUID-VkImportMemoryHostPointerInfoEXT-pHostPointer-01749
