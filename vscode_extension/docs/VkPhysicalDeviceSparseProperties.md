# VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties - Structure specifying physical device sparse memory properties



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties {
    VkBool32    residencyStandard2DBlockShape;
    VkBool32    residencyStandard2DMultisampleBlockShape;
    VkBool32    residencyStandard3DBlockShape;
    VkBool32    residencyAlignedMipSize;
    VkBool32    residencyNonResidentStrict;
} VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties;
```

## [](#_members)Members

- `residencyStandard2DBlockShape` is `VK_TRUE` if the physical device will access all single-sample 2D sparse resources using the standard sparse image block shapes (based on image format), as described in the [Standard Sparse Image Block Shapes (Single Sample)](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#sparsememory-sparseblockshapessingle) table. If this property is not supported the value returned in the `imageGranularity` member of the `VkSparseImageFormatProperties` structure for single-sample 2D images is not **required** to match the standard sparse image block dimensions listed in the table.
- `residencyStandard2DMultisampleBlockShape` is `VK_TRUE` if the physical device will access all multisample 2D sparse resources using the standard sparse image block shapes (based on image format), as described in the [Standard Sparse Image Block Shapes (MSAA)](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#sparsememory-sparseblockshapesmsaa) table. If this property is not supported, the value returned in the `imageGranularity` member of the `VkSparseImageFormatProperties` structure for multisample 2D images is not **required** to match the standard sparse image block dimensions listed in the table.
- `residencyStandard3DBlockShape` is `VK_TRUE` if the physical device will access all 3D sparse resources using the standard sparse image block shapes (based on image format), as described in the [Standard Sparse Image Block Shapes (Single Sample)](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#sparsememory-sparseblockshapessingle) table. If this property is not supported, the value returned in the `imageGranularity` member of the `VkSparseImageFormatProperties` structure for 3D images is not **required** to match the standard sparse image block dimensions listed in the table.
- `residencyAlignedMipSize` is `VK_TRUE` if images with mip level dimensions that are not integer multiples of the corresponding dimensions of the sparse image block **may** be placed in the mip tail. If this property is not reported, only mip levels with dimensions smaller than the `imageGranularity` member of the `VkSparseImageFormatProperties` structure will be placed in the mip tail. If this property is reported the implementation is allowed to return `VK_SPARSE_IMAGE_FORMAT_ALIGNED_MIP_SIZE_BIT` in the `flags` member of `VkSparseImageFormatProperties`, indicating that mip level dimensions that are not integer multiples of the corresponding dimensions of the sparse image block will be placed in the mip tail.
- `residencyNonResidentStrict` specifies whether the physical device **can** consistently access non-resident regions of a resource. If this property is `VK_TRUE`, access to non-resident regions of resources will be guaranteed to return values as if the resource was populated with 0; writes to non-resident regions will be discarded.
