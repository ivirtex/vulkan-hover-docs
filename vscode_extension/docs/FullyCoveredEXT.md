# FullyCoveredEXT(3) Manual Page

## Name

FullyCoveredEXT - Indication of whether a fragment is fully covered



## [](#_description)Description

`FullyCoveredEXT`

Decorating a variable with the `FullyCoveredEXT` built-in decoration will make that variable indicate whether the [fragment area](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#glossary-fragment-area) is fully covered by the generating primitive. This variable is non-zero if conservative rasterization is enabled and the current fragment area is fully covered by the generating primitive, and is zero if the fragment is not covered or partially covered, or conservative rasterization is disabled.

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-FullyCoveredEXT-FullyCoveredEXT-04232)VUID-FullyCoveredEXT-FullyCoveredEXT-04232  
  The `FullyCoveredEXT` decoration **must** be used only within the `Fragment` `Execution` `Model`
- [](#VUID-FullyCoveredEXT-FullyCoveredEXT-04233)VUID-FullyCoveredEXT-FullyCoveredEXT-04233  
  The variable decorated with `FullyCoveredEXT` **must** be declared using the `Input` `Storage` `Class`
- [](#VUID-FullyCoveredEXT-FullyCoveredEXT-04234)VUID-FullyCoveredEXT-FullyCoveredEXT-04234  
  The variable decorated with `FullyCoveredEXT` **must** be declared as a boolean value
- [](#VUID-FullyCoveredEXT-conservativeRasterizationPostDepthCoverage-04235)VUID-FullyCoveredEXT-conservativeRasterizationPostDepthCoverage-04235  
  If `VkPhysicalDeviceConservativeRasterizationPropertiesEXT`::`conservativeRasterizationPostDepthCoverage` is not supported the `PostDepthCoverage` `Execution` `Mode` **must** not be declared, when a variable with the `FullyCoveredEXT` decoration is declared
