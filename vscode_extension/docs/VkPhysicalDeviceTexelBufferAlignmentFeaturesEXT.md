# VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT - Structure describing the texel buffer alignment features that can be supported by an implementation



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_texel_buffer_alignment
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           texelBufferAlignment;
} VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following feature:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- []()`texelBufferAlignment` indicates whether the implementation uses more specific alignment requirements advertised in [VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentProperties](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentProperties.html) rather than [VkPhysicalDeviceLimits](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceLimits.html)::`minTexelBufferOffsetAlignment`.

## [](#_description)Description

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceTexelBufferAlignmentFeaturesEXT-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TEXEL_BUFFER_ALIGNMENT_FEATURES_EXT`
