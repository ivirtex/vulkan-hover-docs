# VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures - Structure describing the subgroup size control features that can be supported by an implementation



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           subgroupSizeControl;
    VkBool32           computeFullSubgroups;
} VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures;
```

or the equivalent

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeaturesEXT;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following features:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.

## [](#_description)Description

- []()`subgroupSizeControl` indicates whether the implementation supports controlling shader subgroup sizes via the `VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_ALLOW_VARYING_SUBGROUP_SIZE_BIT` flag and the [VkPipelineShaderStageRequiredSubgroupSizeCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPipelineShaderStageRequiredSubgroupSizeCreateInfo.html) structure.
- []()`computeFullSubgroups` indicates whether the implementation supports requiring full subgroups in compute , mesh, or task shaders via the `VK_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_REQUIRE_FULL_SUBGROUPS_BIT` flag.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Note

The `VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeaturesEXT` structure was added in version 2 of the `VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control` extension. Version 1 implementations of this extension will not fill out the features structure but applications may assume that both `subgroupSizeControl` and `computeFullSubgroups` are supported if the extension is supported. (See also the [Feature Requirements](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-requirements) section.) Applications are advised to add a `VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeaturesEXT` structure to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) to enable the features regardless of the version of the extension supported by the implementation. If the implementation only supports version 1, it will safely ignore the `VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeaturesEXT` structure.

Vulkan 1.3 implementations always support the features structure.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupSizeControlFeatures-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SUBGROUP_SIZE_CONTROL_FEATURES`
