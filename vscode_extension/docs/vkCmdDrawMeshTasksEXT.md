## Name

vkCmdDrawMeshTasksEXT - Draw mesh task work items



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

To record a mesh tasks drawing command, call:

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_mesh_shader
void vkCmdDrawMeshTasksEXT(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    groupCountX,
    uint32_t                                    groupCountY,
    uint32_t                                    groupCountZ);
```

## [](#_parameters)Parameters

- `commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command will be recorded.
- `groupCountX` is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the X dimension.
- `groupCountY` is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the Y dimension.
- `groupCountZ` is the number of local workgroups to dispatch in the Z dimension.

## [](#_description)Description

When the command is executed, a global workgroup consisting of `groupCountX` × `groupCountY` × `groupCountZ` local workgroups is assembled.
