# VkMemoryHeapFlagBits(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkMemoryHeapFlagBits - Bitmask specifying attribute flags for a heap



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

Bits which **may** be set in [VkMemoryHeap](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkMemoryHeap.html)::`flags`, indicating attribute flags for the heap, are:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef enum VkMemoryHeapFlagBits {
    VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT = 0x00000001,
  // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
    VK_MEMORY_HEAP_MULTI_INSTANCE_BIT = 0x00000002,
  // Provided by VK_QCOM_tile_memory_heap
    VK_MEMORY_HEAP_TILE_MEMORY_BIT_QCOM = 0x00000008,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_device_group_creation
    VK_MEMORY_HEAP_MULTI_INSTANCE_BIT_KHR = VK_MEMORY_HEAP_MULTI_INSTANCE_BIT,
} VkMemoryHeapFlagBits;
```

## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT` specifies that the heap corresponds to device-local memory. Device-local memory **may** have different performance characteristics than host-local memory, and **may** support different memory property flags.
- `VK_MEMORY_HEAP_MULTI_INSTANCE_BIT` specifies that in a logical device representing more than one physical device, there is a per-physical device instance of the heap memory. By default, an allocation from such a heap will be replicated to each physical deviceâ€™s instance of the heap.
- `VK_MEMORY_HEAP_TILE_MEMORY_BIT_QCOM` bit specifies that the heap corresponds to tile memory.
