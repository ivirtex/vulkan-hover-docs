## [](#_description)Description

This extension adds support for a new query type to match OpenGLâ€™s `GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED` to support layering.

## [](#_issues)Issues

1\) Can the query from `VK_EXT_transform_feedback` be used instead?

**RESOLVED**: No. While the query from VK\_EXT\_transform\_feedback can produce the same results as in this extension, it is only available while transform feedback is active. The OpenGL `GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED` query is independent from transform feedback. Emulation through artificial transform feedback is unnecessarily inefficient.

2\) Can `VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT` be used instead?

**RESOLVED**: It could, but we prefer the extension for simplicity. Vulkan requires that only one query be active at a time. If both the `GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED` and the `GL_CLIPPING_INPUT_PRIMITIVES_ARB` queries need to be simultaneously enabled, emulation of both through `VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT` is inconvenient.

3\) On some hardware, this query cannot be implemented if `VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo`::`rasterizerDiscardEnable` is enabled. How will this be handled?

**RESOLVED**: A feature flag is exposed by this extension for this. On said hardware, the GL implementation disables rasterizer-discard and achieves the same effect through other means. It will not be able to do the same in Vulkan due to lack of state information. A feature flag is exposed by this extension so the OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan would be able to implement a similar workaround.

4\) On some hardware, this query cannot be implemented for non-zero query indices. How will this be handled?

**RESOLVED**: A feature flag is exposed by this extension for this. If this feature is not present, the query from `VK_EXT_transform_feedback` can be used to the same effect.

5\) How is the interaction of this extension with `transformFeedbackRasterizationStreamSelect` handled?

**RESOLVED**: Disallowed for non-zero streams. In OpenGL, the rasterization stream is always stream zero.
