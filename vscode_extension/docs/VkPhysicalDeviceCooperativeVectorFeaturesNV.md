## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV - Structure describing cooperative vector features that can be supported by an implementation



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_NV_cooperative_vector
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           cooperativeVector;
    VkBool32           cooperativeVectorTraining;
} VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following features:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- []()`cooperativeVector` indicates that the implementation supports the `CooperativeVectorNV` SPIR-V capability.
- []()`cooperativeVectorTraining` indicates that the implementation supports the `CooperativeVectorTrainingNV` SPIR-V capability.

## [](#_description)Description

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceCooperativeVectorFeaturesNV-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_COOPERATIVE_VECTOR_FEATURES_NV`
