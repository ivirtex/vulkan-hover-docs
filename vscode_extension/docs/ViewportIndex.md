# ViewportIndex(3) Manual Page

## Name

ViewportIndex - Viewport index used



## [](#_description)Description

`ViewportIndex`

Decorating a variable with the `ViewportIndex` built-in decoration will make that variable contain the index of the viewport.

In a mesh, vertex, tessellation evaluation, or geometry shader, the variable decorated with `ViewportIndex` can be written to with the viewport index to which the primitive produced by that shader will be directed.

The selected viewport index is used to select the viewport transform, scissor rectangle, and exclusive scissor rectangle.

The last active [*pre-rasterization shader stage*](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) (in pipeline order) controls the `ViewportIndex` that is used. Outputs in previous shader stages are not used, even if the last stage fails to write the `ViewportIndex`.

If the last active [pre-rasterization shader stage](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader entry point’s interface does not include a variable decorated with `ViewportIndex` , and if the [multiviewPerViewViewports](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-multiviewPerViewViewports) feature is not enabled, then the first viewport is used. If a [pre-rasterization shader stage](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader entry point’s interface includes a variable decorated with `ViewportIndex`, it **must** write the same value to `ViewportIndex` for all output vertices of a given primitive.

In a fragment shader, the variable decorated with `ViewportIndex` contains the viewport index of the primitive that the fragment invocation belongs to.

If the [`multiviewPerViewViewports`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-multiviewPerViewViewports) feature is enabled, and if the last active [pre-rasterization shader stage](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader entry point’s interface does not include a variable decorated with `ViewportIndex`, then the value of `ViewIndex` is used as an index to select the viewport transform and scissor rectangle, and the value of `ViewportIndex` in the fragment shader is undefined.

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-04404)VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-04404  
  The `ViewportIndex` decoration **must** be used only within the `MeshEXT`, `MeshNV`, `Vertex`, `TessellationEvaluation`, `Geometry`, or `Fragment` `Execution` `Model`

  If the [`shaderOutputViewportIndex`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-shaderOutputViewportIndex) feature is not enabled then the `ViewportIndex` decoration **must** be used only within the `Geometry` or `Fragment` `Execution` `Model`
- [](#VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-04406)VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-04406  
  The variable decorated with `ViewportIndex` within the `MeshEXT`, `MeshNV`, `Vertex`, `TessellationEvaluation`, or `Geometry` `Execution` `Model` **must** be declared using the `Output` `Storage` `Class`
- [](#VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-04407)VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-04407

- [](#VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-04408)VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-04408  
  The variable decorated with `ViewportIndex` **must** be declared as a scalar 32-bit integer value for all supported execution models except `MeshEXT`
- [](#VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-07060)VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-07060  
  The variable decorated with `ViewportIndex` within the `MeshEXT` `Execution` `Model` **must** also be decorated with the `PerPrimitiveEXT` decoration
- [](#VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-10601)VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-10601  
  `ViewportIndex` within the `MeshEXT` `Execution` `Model` **must** decorate a scalar boolean member of a structure decorated as `Block`, or decorate a variable of type `OpTypeArray` of boolean values
- [](#VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-10602)VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-10602  
  If `ViewportIndex` is declared as an array of boolean values, the size of the array **must** match the value specified by `OutputPrimitivesEXT`
- [](#VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-10603)VUID-ViewportIndex-ViewportIndex-10603  
  If `ViewportIndex` decorates a member of a structure, the variable declaration of the containing `Block` type **must** have an array size that matches the value specified by `OutputPrimitivesEXT`
