# WorkgroupId(3) Manual Page

## Name

WorkgroupId - Workgroup ID of a shader



## [](#_description)Description

`WorkgroupId`

Decorating a variable with the `WorkgroupId` built-in decoration will make that variable contain the global coordinate of the local workgroup that the current invocation is a member of. Each component is in the range [base,base + count), where base and count are based on the parameters passed into the dispatching or drawing commands in each dimension.

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-WorkgroupId-WorkgroupId-04422)VUID-WorkgroupId-WorkgroupId-04422  
  The `WorkgroupId` decoration **must** be used only within the `GLCompute`, `MeshEXT`, `TaskEXT`, `MeshNV`, or `TaskNV` `Execution` `Model`
- [](#VUID-WorkgroupId-WorkgroupId-04423)VUID-WorkgroupId-WorkgroupId-04423  
  The variable decorated with `WorkgroupId` **must** be declared using the `Input` `Storage` `Class`
- [](#VUID-WorkgroupId-WorkgroupId-04424)VUID-WorkgroupId-WorkgroupId-04424
