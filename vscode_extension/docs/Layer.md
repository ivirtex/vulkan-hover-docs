## Name

Layer - Layer index for layered rendering



## [](#_description)Description

`Layer`

Decorating a variable with the `Layer` built-in decoration will make that variable contain the select layer of a multi-layer framebuffer attachment.

In a mesh, vertex, tessellation evaluation, or geometry shader, any variable decorated with `Layer` can be written with the framebuffer layer index to which the primitive produced by that shader will be directed.

The last active [pre-rasterization shader stage](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) (in pipeline order) controls the `Layer` that is used. Outputs in previous shader stages are not used, even if the last stage fails to write the `Layer`.

If the last active [pre-rasterization shader stage](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader entry point’s interface does not include a variable decorated with `Layer`, then the first layer is used. If a [pre-rasterization shader stage](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader entry point’s interface includes a variable decorated with `Layer`, it **must** write the same value to `Layer` for all output vertices of a given primitive. If the `Layer` value is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the number of layers in the framebuffer, then primitives **may** still be rasterized, fragment shaders **may** be executed, and the framebuffer values for all layers are undefined. In a mesh shader this also applies when the `Layer` value is greater than or equal to the `maxMeshOutputLayers` limit.

If a variable with the `Layer` decoration is also decorated with `ViewportRelativeNV`, then the `ViewportIndex` is added to the layer that is used for rendering and that is made available in the fragment shader.

If the shader writes to a variable decorated `ViewportMaskNV`, then the layer selected has a different value for each viewport a primitive is rendered to.

In a fragment shader, a variable decorated with `Layer` contains the layer index of the primitive that the fragment invocation belongs to.

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-Layer-Layer-04272)VUID-Layer-Layer-04272  
  The `Layer` decoration **must** be used only within the `MeshEXT`, `MeshNV`, `Vertex`, `TessellationEvaluation`, `Geometry`, or `Fragment` `Execution` `Model`
- [](#VUID-Layer-Layer-04273)VUID-Layer-Layer-04273  
  If the [`shaderOutputLayer`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-shaderOutputLayer) feature is not enabled then the `Layer` decoration **must** be used only within the `Geometry` or `Fragment` `Execution` `Model`
- [](#VUID-Layer-Layer-04274)VUID-Layer-Layer-04274  
  The variable decorated with `Layer` within the `MeshEXT`, `MeshNV`, `Vertex`, `TessellationEvaluation`, or `Geometry` `Execution` `Model` **must** be declared using the `Output` `Storage` `Class`
- [](#VUID-Layer-Layer-04275)VUID-Layer-Layer-04275  
  The variable decorated with `Layer` within the `Fragment` `Execution` `Model` **must** be declared using the `Input` `Storage` `Class`
- [](#VUID-Layer-Layer-04276)VUID-Layer-Layer-04276  
  The variable decorated with `Layer` **must** be declared as a scalar 32-bit integer value for all supported execution models except `MeshEXT`
- [](#VUID-Layer-Layer-07039)VUID-Layer-Layer-07039  
  The variable decorated with `Layer` within the `MeshEXT` `Execution` `Model` **must** also be decorated with the `PerPrimitiveEXT` decoration
- [](#VUID-Layer-Layer-10592)VUID-Layer-Layer-10592  
  `Layer` within the `MeshEXT` `Execution` `Model` **must** decorate a scalar 32-bit integer member of a structure decorated as `Block`, or decorate a variable of type `OpTypeArray` of scalar 32-bit integer values
- [](#VUID-Layer-Layer-10593)VUID-Layer-Layer-10593  
  If `Layer` is declared as an array of 32-bit integer values, within the `MeshEXT` `Execution` `Model`, size of the array **must** match the value specified by `OutputPrimitivesEXT`
- [](#VUID-Layer-Layer-10594)VUID-Layer-Layer-10594  
  If `Layer` decorates a member of a structure, the variable declaration of the containing `Block` type **must** have an array size that matches the value specified by `OutputPrimitivesEXT`
