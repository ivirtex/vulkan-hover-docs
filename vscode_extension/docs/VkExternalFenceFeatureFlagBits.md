# VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBits(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBits - Bitfield describing features of an external fence handle type



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

Bits which **may** be set in [VkExternalFenceProperties](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkExternalFenceProperties.html)::`externalFenceFeatures`, indicating features of a fence external handle type, are:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef enum VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBits {
    VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_EXPORTABLE_BIT = 0x00000001,
    VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_IMPORTABLE_BIT = 0x00000002,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities
    VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_EXPORTABLE_BIT_KHR = VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_EXPORTABLE_BIT,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities
    VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_IMPORTABLE_BIT_KHR = VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_IMPORTABLE_BIT,
} VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBits;
```

or the equivalent

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_external_fence_capabilities
typedef VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBits VkExternalFenceFeatureFlagBitsKHR;
```

## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_EXPORTABLE_BIT` specifies handles of this type **can** be exported from Vulkan fence objects.
- `VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_FEATURE_IMPORTABLE_BIT` specifies handles of this type **can** be imported to Vulkan fence objects.
