## Name

vkFreeMemory - Free device memory



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

To free a memory object, call:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
void vkFreeMemory(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkDeviceMemory                              memory,
    const VkAllocationCallbacks*                pAllocator);
```

## [](#_parameters)Parameters

- `device` is the logical device that owns the memory.
- `memory` is the [VkDeviceMemory](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceMemory.html) object to be freed.
- `pAllocator` controls host memory allocation as described in the [Memory Allocation](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#memory-allocation) chapter.

## [](#_description)Description

Before freeing a memory object, an application **must** ensure the memory object is no longer in use by the device — for example by command buffers in the *pending state*. Memory **can** be freed whilst still bound to resources, but those resources **must** not be used afterwards. Freeing a memory object releases the reference it held, if any, to its payload. If there are still any bound images or buffers, the memory object’s payload **may** not be immediately released by the implementation, but **must** be released by the time all bound images and buffers have been destroyed. Once all references to a payload are released, it is returned to the heap from which it was allocated.

How memory objects are bound to Images and Buffers is described in detail in the [Resource Memory Association](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#resources-association) section.

If a memory object is mapped at the time it is freed, it is implicitly unmapped.

Note

As described [below](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#memory-device-unmap-does-not-flush), host writes are not implicitly flushed when the memory object is unmapped, but the implementation **must** guarantee that writes that have not been flushed do not affect any other memory.

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-vkFreeMemory-memory-00677)VUID-vkFreeMemory-memory-00677  
  All submitted commands that refer to `memory` (via images or buffers) **must** have completed execution

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-vkFreeMemory-device-parameter)VUID-vkFreeMemory-device-parameter  
  `device` **must** be a valid [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) handle
- [](#VUID-vkFreeMemory-memory-parameter)VUID-vkFreeMemory-memory-parameter  
  If `memory` is not [VK\_NULL\_HANDLE](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_NULL_HANDLE.html), `memory` **must** be a valid [VkDeviceMemory](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceMemory.html) handle
- [](#VUID-vkFreeMemory-pAllocator-parameter)VUID-vkFreeMemory-pAllocator-parameter  
  If `pAllocator` is not `NULL`, `pAllocator` **must** be a valid pointer to a valid [VkAllocationCallbacks](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkAllocationCallbacks.html) structure
- [](#VUID-vkFreeMemory-memory-parent)VUID-vkFreeMemory-memory-parent  
  If `memory` is a valid handle, it **must** have been created, allocated, or retrieved from `device`

Host Synchronization

- Host access to `memory` **must** be externally synchronized
