# VkAttachmentLoadOp(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkAttachmentLoadOp - Specify how contents of an attachment are treated at the beginning of the subpass where it is first used



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

Load operations that **can** be used for a render pass are:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef enum VkAttachmentLoadOp {
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD = 0,
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR = 1,
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE = 2,
  // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_4
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE = 1000400000,
  // Provided by VK_EXT_load_store_op_none
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE_EXT = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_load_store_op_none
    VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE_KHR = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE,
} VkAttachmentLoadOp;
```

## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD` specifies that the previous contents of the image within the render area will be preserved as the initial values. For attachments with a depth/stencil format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT`. For attachments with a color format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_READ_BIT`.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR` specifies that the contents within the render area will be cleared to a uniform value, which is specified when a render pass instance is begun. For attachments with a depth/stencil format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`. For attachments with a color format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE` specifies that the previous contents within the area need not be preserved; the contents of the attachment will be undefined inside the render area. For attachments with a depth/stencil format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`. For attachments with a color format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_NONE` specifies that the previous contents of the image will be undefined inside the render pass. No access type is used as the image is not accessed.
