# VkBindVertexBufferIndirectCommandEXT(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkBindVertexBufferIndirectCommandEXT - Structure specifying input data for a single vertex buffer command token



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkBindVertexBufferIndirectCommandEXT` structure specifies the input data for the `VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_TOKEN_TYPE_VERTEX_BUFFER_EXT` token.

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_device_generated_commands
typedef struct VkBindVertexBufferIndirectCommandEXT {
    VkDeviceAddress    bufferAddress;
    uint32_t           size;
    uint32_t           stride;
} VkBindVertexBufferIndirectCommandEXT;
```

## [](#_members)Members

- `bufferAddress` specifies a physical address of the [VkBuffer](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkBuffer.html) used as vertex input binding.
- `size` is the byte size range which is available for this operation from the provided address.
- `stride` is the byte size stride for this vertex input binding as in `VkVertexInputBindingDescription`::`stride`.

## [](#_description)Description

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-VkBindVertexBufferIndirectCommandEXT-None-11120)VUID-VkBindVertexBufferIndirectCommandEXT-None-11120  
  The bufferâ€™s usage flag from which the address was acquired **must** have the `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT` bit set
- [](#VUID-VkBindVertexBufferIndirectCommandEXT-None-11121)VUID-VkBindVertexBufferIndirectCommandEXT-None-11121  
  Each element of the buffer from which the address was acquired and that is non-sparse **must** be bound completely and contiguously to a single `VkDeviceMemory` object
