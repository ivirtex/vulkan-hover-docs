# VkColorComponentFlagBits(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkColorComponentFlagBits - Bitmask controlling which components are written to the framebuffer



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

Bits which **can** be set in [VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState.html)::`colorWriteMask`, determining whether the final color values R, G, B and A are written to the framebuffer attachment, are:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef enum VkColorComponentFlagBits {
    VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_R_BIT = 0x00000001,
    VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_G_BIT = 0x00000002,
    VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_B_BIT = 0x00000004,
    VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_A_BIT = 0x00000008,
} VkColorComponentFlagBits;
```

## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_R_BIT` specifies that the R value is written to the color attachment for the appropriate sample. Otherwise, the value in memory is unmodified.
- `VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_G_BIT` specifies that the G value is written to the color attachment for the appropriate sample. Otherwise, the value in memory is unmodified.
- `VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_B_BIT` specifies that the B value is written to the color attachment for the appropriate sample. Otherwise, the value in memory is unmodified.
- `VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_A_BIT` specifies that the A value is written to the color attachment for the appropriate sample. Otherwise, the value in memory is unmodified.

The color write mask operation is applied regardless of whether blending is enabled.

The color write mask operation is applied only if [Color Write Enable](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#framebuffer-color-write-enable) is enabled for the respective attachment. Otherwise the color write mask is ignored and writes to all components of the attachment are disabled.
