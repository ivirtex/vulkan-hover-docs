# VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR - Fences associated with a vkQueuePresentKHR operation



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_swapchain_maintenance1
typedef struct VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    const void*        pNext;
    uint32_t           swapchainCount;
    const VkFence*     pFences;
} VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR;
```

or the equivalent

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1
typedef VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoEXT;
```

## [](#_members)Members

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- `swapchainCount` is the number of swapchains being presented to by this command.
- `pFences` is a list of fences with `swapchainCount` entries. Each entry **must** be [VK\_NULL\_HANDLE](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_NULL_HANDLE.html) or the handle of a fence to signal when the relevant operations on the associated swapchain have completed.

## [](#_description)Description

The set of *queue operations* defined by queuing an image for presentation, as well as operations performed by the presentation engine, access the payloads of objects associated with the presentation operation. The associated objects include:

- The swapchain image, its implicitly bound memory, and any other resources bound to that memory.
- The wait semaphores specified when queuing the image for presentation.

The application **can** provide a fence that the implementation will signal after all such queue operations have completed, and after the presentation engine has taken a reference to the payloads of all objects provided in `VkPresentInfoKHR` that the presentation engine accesses as part of the present operation. The fence **may** not wait for the present operation to complete. For all binary wait semaphores imported by the presentation engine using the equivalent of reference transference, as described in [Importing Semaphore Payloads](#synchronization-semaphores-importing), this fence **must** not signal until all such semaphore payloads have been reset by the presentation engine.

The application **can** destroy the wait semaphores associated with a given presentation operation when at least one of the associated fences is signaled, and **can** destroy the swapchain when the fences associated with all past presentation requests referring to that swapchain have signaled.

Fences associated with presentations to the same swapchain on the same [VkQueue](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkQueue.html) **must** be signaled in the same order as the present operations.

To specify a fence for each swapchain in a present operation, include the `VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR` structure in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPresentInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPresentInfoKHR.html) structure.

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-swapchainCount-07757)VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-swapchainCount-07757  
  `swapchainCount` **must** be equal to [VkPresentInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPresentInfoKHR.html)::`swapchainCount`
- [](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07758)VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07758  
  Each element of `pFences` that is not [VK\_NULL\_HANDLE](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_NULL_HANDLE.html) **must** be unsignaled
- [](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07759)VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-07759  
  Each element of `pFences` that is not [VK\_NULL\_HANDLE](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_NULL_HANDLE.html) **must** not be associated with any other queue command that has not yet completed execution on that queue

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-sType-sType)VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SWAPCHAIN_PRESENT_FENCE_INFO_KHR`
- [](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-parameter)VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-pFences-parameter  
  `pFences` **must** be a valid pointer to an array of `swapchainCount` valid or [VK\_NULL\_HANDLE](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_NULL_HANDLE.html) [VkFence](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkFence.html) handles
- [](#VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-swapchainCount-arraylength)VUID-VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoKHR-swapchainCount-arraylength  
  `swapchainCount` **must** be greater than `0`
