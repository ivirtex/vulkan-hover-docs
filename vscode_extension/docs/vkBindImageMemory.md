## Name

vkBindImageMemory - Bind device memory to an image object



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

To attach memory to a `VkImage` object created without the `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_DISJOINT_BIT` set, call:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
VkResult vkBindImageMemory(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkImage                                     image,
    VkDeviceMemory                              memory,
    VkDeviceSize                                memoryOffset);
```

## [](#_parameters)Parameters

- `device` is the logical device that owns the image and memory.
- `image` is the image.
- `memory` is the [VkDeviceMemory](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceMemory.html) object describing the device memory to attach.
- `memoryOffset` is the start offset of the region of `memory` which is to be bound to the image. The number of bytes returned in the `VkMemoryRequirements`::`size` member in `memory`, starting from `memoryOffset` bytes, will be bound to the specified image.

## [](#_description)Description

`vkBindImageMemory` is equivalent to passing the same parameters through [VkBindImageMemoryInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkBindImageMemoryInfo.html) to [vkBindImageMemory2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkBindImageMemory2.html).
