## [](#_description)Description

This extension defines a special queue family, `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT`, which can be used to transfer ownership of resources backed by external memory to foreign, external queues. This is similar to `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR`, defined in `VK_KHR_external_memory`. The key differences between the two are:

- The queues represented by `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR` must share the same physical device and the same driver version as the current [VkInstance](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkInstance.html). `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT` has no such restrictions. It can represent devices and drivers from other vendors, and can even represent non-Vulkan-capable devices.
- All resources backed by external memory support `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR`. Support for `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT` is more restrictive.
- Applications should expect transitions to/from `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_FOREIGN_EXT` to be more expensive than transitions to/from `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL_KHR`.
