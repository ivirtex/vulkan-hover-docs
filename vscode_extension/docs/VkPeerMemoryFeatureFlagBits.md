# VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagBits(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagBits - Bitmask specifying supported peer memory features



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

Bits which **may** be set in [vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeatures](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetDeviceGroupPeerMemoryFeatures.html)::`pPeerMemoryFeatures`, indicating supported peer memory features, are:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef enum VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagBits {
    VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_SRC_BIT = 0x00000001,
    VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_DST_BIT = 0x00000002,
    VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_SRC_BIT = 0x00000004,
    VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_DST_BIT = 0x00000008,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_device_group
    VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_SRC_BIT_KHR = VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_SRC_BIT,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_device_group
    VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_DST_BIT_KHR = VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_DST_BIT,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_device_group
    VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_SRC_BIT_KHR = VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_SRC_BIT,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_device_group
    VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_DST_BIT_KHR = VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_DST_BIT,
} VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagBits;
```

or the equivalent

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_device_group
typedef VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagBits VkPeerMemoryFeatureFlagBitsKHR;
```

## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_SRC_BIT` specifies that the memory **can** be accessed as the source of any `vkCmdCopy*` command.
- `VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_DST_BIT` specifies that the memory **can** be accessed as the destination of any `vkCmdCopy*` command.
- `VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_SRC_BIT` specifies that the memory **can** be read as any memory access type.
- `VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_GENERIC_DST_BIT` specifies that the memory **can** be written as any memory access type. Shader atomics are considered to be writes.

Note

The peer memory features of a memory heap also apply to any accesses that **may** be performed during [image layout transitions](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-image-layout-transitions).

`VK_PEER_MEMORY_FEATURE_COPY_DST_BIT` **must** be supported for all host local heaps and for at least one device-local memory heap.

If a device does not support a peer memory feature, it is still valid to use a resource that includes both local and peer memory bindings with the corresponding access type as long as only the local bindings are actually accessed. For example, an application doing split-frame rendering would use framebuffer attachments that include both local and peer memory bindings, but would scissor the rendering to only update local memory.
