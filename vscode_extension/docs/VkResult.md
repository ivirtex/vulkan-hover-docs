VkResult - Vulkan command return codes



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

While the core Vulkan API is not designed to capture incorrect usage, some circumstances still require return codes. Commands in Vulkan return their status via return codes that are in one of two categories:

- Successful completion codes are returned when a command needs to communicate success or status information. All successful completion codes are non-negative values.
- Runtime error codes are returned when a command needs to communicate a failure that could only be detected at runtime. All runtime error codes are negative values.

All return codes in Vulkan are reported via [VkResult](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkResult.html) return values. The possible codes are:

## [](#_description)Description

Success Codes

- `VK_SUCCESS` Command successfully completed
- `VK_NOT_READY` A fence or query has not yet completed
- `VK_TIMEOUT` A wait operation has not completed in the specified time
- `VK_EVENT_SET` An event is signaled
- `VK_EVENT_RESET` An event is unsignaled
- `VK_INCOMPLETE` A return array was too small for the result
- `VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR` A swapchain no longer matches the surface properties exactly, but **can** still be used to present to the surface successfully.
- `VK_THREAD_IDLE_KHR` A deferred operation is not complete but there is currently no work for this thread to do at the time of this call.
- `VK_THREAD_DONE_KHR` A deferred operation is not complete but there is no work remaining to assign to additional threads.
- `VK_OPERATION_DEFERRED_KHR` A deferred operation was requested and at least some of the work was deferred.
- `VK_OPERATION_NOT_DEFERRED_KHR` A deferred operation was requested and no operations were deferred.
- `VK_PIPELINE_COMPILE_REQUIRED` A requested pipeline creation would have required compilation, but the application requested compilation to not be performed.
- `VK_PIPELINE_BINARY_MISSING_KHR` The application attempted to create a pipeline binary by querying an internal cache, but the internal cache entry did not exist.
- `VK_INCOMPATIBLE_SHADER_BINARY_EXT` The provided binary shader code is not compatible with this device.
  
  Note
  
  In the initial version of the `VK_EXT_shader_object` extension, this return code was named `VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_SHADER_BINARY_EXT` and improperly described as an error code. The name has been changed, but the old name is retained as an alias for compatibility with old code.

Error Codes

- `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` A host memory allocation has failed.
- `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY` A device memory allocation has failed.
- `VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED` Initialization of an object could not be completed for implementation-specific reasons.
- `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` The logical or physical device has been lost. See [Lost Device](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#devsandqueues-lost-device)
- `VK_ERROR_MEMORY_MAP_FAILED` Mapping of a memory object has failed.
- `VK_ERROR_LAYER_NOT_PRESENT` A requested layer is not present or could not be loaded.
- `VK_ERROR_EXTENSION_NOT_PRESENT` A requested extension is not supported.
- `VK_ERROR_FEATURE_NOT_PRESENT` A requested feature is not supported.
- `VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER` The requested version of Vulkan is not supported by the driver or is otherwise incompatible for implementation-specific reasons.
- `VK_ERROR_TOO_MANY_OBJECTS` Too many objects of the type have already been created.
- `VK_ERROR_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED` A requested format is not supported on this device.
- `VK_ERROR_FRAGMENTED_POOL` A pool allocation has failed due to fragmentation of the poolâ€™s memory. This **must** only be returned if no attempt to allocate host or device memory was made to accommodate the new allocation. This **should** be returned in preference to `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_POOL_MEMORY`, but only if the implementation is certain that the pool allocation failure was due to fragmentation.
- `VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST_KHR` A surface is no longer available.
- `VK_ERROR_NATIVE_WINDOW_IN_USE_KHR` The requested window is already in use by Vulkan or another API in a manner which prevents it from being used again.
- `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR` A surface has changed in such a way that it is no longer compatible with the swapchain, and further presentation requests using the swapchain will fail. Applications **must** query the new surface properties and recreate their swapchain if they wish to continue presenting to the surface.
- `VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DISPLAY_KHR` The display used by a swapchain does not use the same presentable image layout, or is incompatible in a way that prevents sharing an image.
- `VK_ERROR_INVALID_SHADER_NV` One or more shaders failed to compile or link. More details are reported back to the application via `VK_EXT_debug_report` if enabled.
- `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_POOL_MEMORY` A pool memory allocation has failed. This **must** only be returned if no attempt to allocate host or device memory was made to accommodate the new allocation. If the failure was definitely due to fragmentation of the pool, `VK_ERROR_FRAGMENTED_POOL` **should** be returned instead.
- `VK_ERROR_INVALID_EXTERNAL_HANDLE` An external handle is not a valid handle of the specified type.
- `VK_ERROR_FRAGMENTATION` A descriptor pool creation has failed due to fragmentation.
- `VK_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE_ADDRESS_EXT` A buffer creation failed because the requested address is not available.
- `VK_ERROR_INVALID_OPAQUE_CAPTURE_ADDRESS` A buffer creation or memory allocation failed because the requested address is not available. A shader group handle assignment failed because the requested shader group handle information is no longer valid.
- `VK_ERROR_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_MODE_LOST_EXT` An operation on a swapchain created with `VK_FULL_SCREEN_EXCLUSIVE_APPLICATION_CONTROLLED_EXT` failed as it did not have exclusive full-screen access. This **may** occur due to implementation-dependent reasons, outside of the applicationâ€™s control.
- `VK_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILED` A command failed because invalid usage was detected by the implementation or a validation layer. This **may** result in the command not being dispatched to the ICD.
- `VK_ERROR_COMPRESSION_EXHAUSTED_EXT` An image creation failed because internal resources required for compression are exhausted. This **must** only be returned when fixed-rate compression is requested.
- `VK_ERROR_IMAGE_USAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED_KHR` The requested [VkImageUsageFlags](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkImageUsageFlags.html) are not supported.
- `VK_ERROR_VIDEO_PICTURE_LAYOUT_NOT_SUPPORTED_KHR` The requested video picture layout is not supported.
- `VK_ERROR_VIDEO_PROFILE_OPERATION_NOT_SUPPORTED_KHR` A video profile operation specified via [VkVideoProfileInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkVideoProfileInfoKHR.html)::`videoCodecOperation` is not supported.
- `VK_ERROR_VIDEO_PROFILE_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED_KHR` Format parameters in a requested [VkVideoProfileInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkVideoProfileInfoKHR.html) chain are not supported.
- `VK_ERROR_VIDEO_PROFILE_CODEC_NOT_SUPPORTED_KHR` Codec-specific parameters in a requested [VkVideoProfileInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkVideoProfileInfoKHR.html) chain are not supported.
- `VK_ERROR_VIDEO_STD_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED_KHR` The specified video Std header version is not supported.
- `VK_ERROR_INVALID_VIDEO_STD_PARAMETERS_KHR` The specified Video Std parameters do not adhere to the syntactic or semantic requirements of the used video compression standard, or values derived from parameters according to the rules defined by the used video compression standard do not adhere to the capabilities of the video compression standard or the implementation.
- `VK_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED` The driver implementation has denied a request to acquire a priority above the default priority (`VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_MEDIUM_EXT`) because the application does not have sufficient privileges.
- `VK_ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE_KHR` The application did not provide enough space to return all the required data.
- `VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN` An unknown error has occurred; either the application has provided invalid input, or an implementation failure has occurred.

If a command returns a runtime error, unless otherwise specified any output parameters will have undefined contents, except that if the output parameter is a structure with `sType` and `pNext` fields, those fields will be unmodified. Any structures chained from `pNext` will also have undefined contents, except that `sType` and `pNext` will be unmodified.

`VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_*_MEMORY` errors do not modify any currently existing Vulkan objects. Objects that have already been successfully created **can** still be used by the application.

Note

As a general rule, `Free`, `Release`, and `Reset` commands do not return `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY`, while any other command with a return code **may** return it. Any exceptions from this rule are described for those commands.

`VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN` will be returned by an implementation when an unexpected error occurs that cannot be attributed to valid behavior of the application and implementation. Under these conditions, it **may** be returned from any command returning a [VkResult](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkResult.html).

Note

`VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN` is not expected to ever be returned if the application behavior is valid, and if the implementation is bug-free. If `VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN` is returned, the application should be checked against the latest validation layers to verify correct behavior as much as possible. If no issues are identified it could be an implementation issue, and the implementor should be contacted for support.

Any command returning a [VkResult](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkResult.html) **may** return `VK_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILED` if a violation of valid usage is detected.

Performance-critical commands generally do not have return codes. If a runtime error occurs in such commands, the implementation will defer reporting the error until a specified point. For commands that record into command buffers (`vkCmd*`) runtime errors are reported by `vkEndCommandBuffer`.
