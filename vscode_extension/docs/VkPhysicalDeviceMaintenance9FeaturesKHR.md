# VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR - Structure describing whether the implementation supports maintenance9 functionality



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance9
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           maintenance9;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following feature:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- []()`maintenance9` indicates that the implementation supports the following:
  
  - The restriction that certain bitfield SPIR-V instructions only operate on 32-bit integers is relaxed.
  - The value returned when a vertex shader reads an unbound vertex attribute is defined by way of the [`defaultVertexAttributeValue`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#limits-defaultVertexAttributeValue) property.
  - A new [VkQueryPoolCreateFlagBits](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkQueryPoolCreateFlagBits.html)::`VK_QUERY_POOL_CREATE_RESET_BIT_KHR` flag **can** be used to initialize all queries in query pool to the reset state on creation.
  - [vkCmdSetEvent2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCmdSetEvent2.html) **may** not provide a dependency other than the event src stage mask.
  - The effects of image memory barriers and image layout transitions on 3D images created with `VK_IMAGE_CREATE_2D_ARRAY_COMPATIBLE_BIT` are limited to only those slices specified in `VkImageSubresourceRange`
  - A device **can** be created with no queues. This can be used for compiling pipelines or shaders for the purpose of filling pipeline caches.
  - Queue family ownership transfers are no longer required when transitioning resources created with `VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE` between queue families that support `VK_QUEUE_GRAPHICS_BIT` and those that support only `VK_QUEUE_TRANSFER_BIT`.
  - [`image2DViewOf3DSparse`](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#limits-image2DViewOf3DSparse) enables 2D views of 3D sparse images.

## [](#_description)Description

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance9FeaturesKHR-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MAINTENANCE_9_FEATURES_KHR`
