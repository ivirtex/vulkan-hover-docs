```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
void vkCmdBeginRenderPass2(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkRenderPassBeginInfo*                pRenderPassBegin,
    const VkSubpassBeginInfo*                   pSubpassBeginInfo);
```

or the equivalent command

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_create_renderpass2
void vkCmdBeginRenderPass2KHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkRenderPassBeginInfo*                pRenderPassBegin,
    const VkSubpassBeginInfo*                   pSubpassBeginInfo);
```

## [](#_parameters)Parameters

- `commandBuffer` is the command buffer in which to record the command.
- `pRenderPassBegin` is a pointer to a [VkRenderPassBeginInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkRenderPassBeginInfo.html) structure specifying the render pass to begin an instance of, and the framebuffer the instance uses. After recording this command, the render pass and framebuffer **may** be accessed at any point that `commandBuffer` is in the recording or pending state until it is reset.
- `pSubpassBeginInfo` is a pointer to a [VkSubpassBeginInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkSubpassBeginInfo.html) structure containing information about the subpass which is about to begin rendering.

## [](#_description)Description

After beginning a render pass instance, the command buffer is ready to record the commands for the first subpass of that render pass.
