# VkPhysicalDeviceShadingRateImageFeaturesNV(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceShadingRateImageFeaturesNV - Structure describing shading rate image features that can be supported by an implementation



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceShadingRateImageFeaturesNV` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_NV_shading_rate_image
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceShadingRateImageFeaturesNV {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           shadingRateImage;
    VkBool32           shadingRateCoarseSampleOrder;
} VkPhysicalDeviceShadingRateImageFeaturesNV;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following features:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- []()`shadingRateImage` indicates that the implementation supports the use of a shading rate image to derive an effective shading rate for fragment processing. It also indicates that the implementation supports the `ShadingRateNV` SPIR-V execution mode.
- []()`shadingRateCoarseSampleOrder` indicates that the implementation supports an application-configurable ordering of coverage samples in fragments larger than one pixel.

## [](#_description)Description

See [Shading Rate Image](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#primsrast-shading-rate-image) for more information.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceShadingRateImageFeaturesNV` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceShadingRateImageFeaturesNV`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShadingRateImageFeaturesNV-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceShadingRateImageFeaturesNV-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SHADING_RATE_IMAGE_FEATURES_NV`
