# PrimitiveId(3) Manual Page

## Name

PrimitiveId - Primitive ID



## [](#_description)Description

`PrimitiveId`

Decorating a variable with the `PrimitiveId` built-in decoration will make that variable contain the index of the current primitive.

The index of the first primitive generated by a drawing command is zero, and the index is incremented after every individual point, line, or triangle primitive is processed.

For triangles drawn as points or line segments (see [Polygon Mode](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#primsrast-polygonmode)), the primitive index is incremented only once, even if multiple points or lines are eventually drawn.

Variables decorated with `PrimitiveId` are reset to zero between each instance drawn.

Restarting a primitive topology using primitive restart has no effect on the value of variables decorated with `PrimitiveId`.

In tessellation control and tessellation evaluation shaders, it will contain the index of the patch within the current set of rendering primitives that corresponds to the shader invocation.

In a geometry shader, it will contain the number of primitives presented as input to the shader since the current set of rendering primitives was started.

In a fragment shader, it will contain the primitive index written by the mesh shader if a mesh shader is present, or the primitive index written by the geometry shader if a geometry shader is present, or with the value that would have been presented as input to the geometry shader had it been present.

In an intersection, any-hit, or closest hit shader, it will contain the index within the geometry of the triangle or bounding box being processed.

Note

When the `PrimitiveId` decoration is applied to an output variable in the mesh shader or geometry shader, the resulting value is seen through the `PrimitiveId` decorated input variable in the fragment shader.

The fragment shader using `PrimitiveId` will need to declare either the `MeshShadingNV`, `MeshShadingEXT`, `Geometry` or `Tessellation` capability to satisfy the requirement SPIR-V has to use `PrimitiveId`.

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-Fragment-04332)VUID-PrimitiveId-Fragment-04332  
  If pipeline contains both the `Fragment` and `MeshEXT` or `MeshNV` `Execution` `Model` and a variable decorated with `PrimitiveId` is read from `Fragment` shader, then the `MeshEXT` or `MeshNV` shader **must** write to the output variables decorated with `PrimitiveId` in all execution paths
- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-Fragment-04333)VUID-PrimitiveId-Fragment-04333  
  If `Fragment` `Execution` `Model` contains a variable decorated with `PrimitiveId`, then either the `MeshShadingEXT`, `MeshShadingNV`, `Geometry` or `Tessellation` capability **must** also be declared
- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-04334)VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-04334  
  The variable decorated with `PrimitiveId` within the `TessellationControl`, `TessellationEvaluation`, `Fragment`, `IntersectionKHR`, `AnyHitKHR`, or `ClosestHitKHR` `Execution` `Model` **must** be declared using the `Input` `Storage` `Class`
- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-04335)VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-04335

- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-04336)VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-04336  
  The variable decorated with `PrimitiveId` within the `MeshEXT` or `MeshNV` `Execution` `Model` **must** be declared using the `Output` `Storage` `Class`
- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-04337)VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-04337  
  The variable decorated with `PrimitiveId` **must** be declared as a scalar 32-bit integer value for all supported execution models except `MeshEXT`
- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-07040)VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-07040  
  The variable decorated with `PrimitiveId` within the `MeshEXT` `Execution` `Model` **must** also be decorated with the `PerPrimitiveEXT` decoration
- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-10595)VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-10595  
  `PrimitiveId` within the `MeshEXT` `Execution` `Model` **must** decorate a scalar 32-bit integer member of a structure decorated as `Block`, or decorate a variable of type `OpTypeArray` of 32-bit integer values
- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-10596)VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-10596  
  If `PrimitiveId` is declared as an array of 32-bit integer values, within the `MeshEXT` `Execution` `Model`, size of the array **must** match the value specified by `OutputPrimitivesEXT`
- [](#VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-10597)VUID-PrimitiveId-PrimitiveId-10597  
  If `PrimitiveId` decorates a member of a structure, the variable declaration of the containing `Block` type **must** have an array size that matches the value specified by `OutputPrimitivesEXT`
