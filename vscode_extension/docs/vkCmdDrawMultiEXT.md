## Name

vkCmdDrawMultiEXT - Draw primitives



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

To record an ordered sequence of draws which have no state changes between them, call:

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_multi_draw
void vkCmdDrawMultiEXT(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    drawCount,
    const VkMultiDrawInfoEXT*                   pVertexInfo,
    uint32_t                                    instanceCount,
    uint32_t                                    firstInstance,
    uint32_t                                    stride);
```

## [](#_parameters)Parameters

- `commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is recorded.
- `drawCount` is the number of draws to execute, and **can** be zero.
- `pVertexInfo` is a pointer to an array of [VkMultiDrawInfoEXT](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkMultiDrawInfoEXT.html) with vertex information to be drawn.
- `instanceCount` is the number of instances per draw.
- `firstInstance` is the instance ID of the first instance in each draw.
- `stride` is the byte stride between consecutive elements of `pVertexInfo`.

## [](#_description)Description

The number of draws recorded is `drawCount`, with each draw reading, sequentially, a `firstVertex` and a `vertexCount` from `pVertexInfo`. For each recorded draw, primitives are assembled as for [vkCmdDraw](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCmdDraw.html), and drawn `instanceCount` times with `instanceIndex` starting with `firstInstance` and sequentially for each instance.
