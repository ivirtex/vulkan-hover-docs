VkFormat - Available image formats



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The following image formats **can** be passed to, and **may** be returned from Vulkan commands. The memory required to store each format is discussed with that format, and also summarized in the [Representation and Texel Block Size](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#texel-block-size) section and the [Compatible formats](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#formats-compatibility) table.

- `VK_FORMAT_R14X2G14X2B14X2A14X2_UNORM_4PACK16_ARM` specifies a four-component, 64-bit unsigned normalized format that has a 14-bit R component in the top 14 bits of the word in bytes 0..1, a 14-bit G component in the top 14 bits of the word in bytes 2..3, a 14-bit B component in the top 14 bits of the word in bytes 4..5, and a 14-bit A component in the top 14 bits of the word in bytes 6..7, with the bottom 2 bits of each word unused.
- `VK_FORMAT_G14X2_B14X2R14X2_2PLANE_420_UNORM_3PACK16_ARM` specifies an unsigned normalized *multi-planar format* that has a 14-bit G component in the top 14 bits of each 16-bit word of plane 0, and a two-component, 32-bit BR plane 1 consisting of a 14-bit B component in the top 14 bits of the word in bytes 0..1, and a 14-bit R component in the top 14 bits of the word in bytes 2..3, with the bottom 2 bits of each word unused. The horizontal and vertical dimensions of the BR plane are halved relative to the image dimensions, and each R and B value is shared with the G components for which ⌊iG​×0.5⌋=iB​=iR​ and ⌊jG​×0.5⌋=jB​=jR​. The location of each plane when this image is in linear layout can be determined via [vkGetImageSubresourceLayout](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetImageSubresourceLayout.html), using `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_0_BIT` for the G plane, and `VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_PLANE_1_BIT` for the BR plane. This format only supports images with a width and height that is a multiple of two.
- `VK_FORMAT_G14X2_B14X2R14X2_2PLANE_422_UNORM_3PACK16_ARM` specifies an unsigned normalized *multi-planar format* that has a 14-bit G component in the top 14 bits of each 16-bit word of plane 0, and a two-component, 32-bit BR plane 1 consisting of a 14-bit B component in the top 14 bits of the word in bytes 0..1, and a 14-bit R component in the top 14 bits of the word in bytes 2..3, with the bottom 2 bits of each word unused. The horizontal dimension of the BR plane is halved relative to the image dimensions, and each R and B value is shared with the G components for which ⌊iG​×0.5⌋=iB​=iR​.

This format only supports images with a width that is a multiple of two.
- `VK_FORMAT_R8_BOOL_ARM` specifies a one-component 8-bit boolean format that has a single 8-bit R component. See [https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#fundamentals-bool](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#fundamentals-bool).
