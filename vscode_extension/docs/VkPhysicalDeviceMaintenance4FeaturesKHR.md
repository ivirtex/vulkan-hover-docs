# VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features - Structure describing whether the implementation supports maintenance4 functionality



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           maintenance4;
} VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features;
```

or the equivalent

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance4
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4FeaturesKHR;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following feature:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.

## [](#_description)Description

- []()`maintenance4` indicates that the implementation supports the following:
  
  - The application **may** destroy a [VkPipelineLayout](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPipelineLayout.html) object immediately after using it to create another object.
  - `LocalSizeId` **can** be used as an alternative to `LocalSize` to specify the local workgroup size with specialization constants.
  - Images created with identical creation parameters will always have the same alignment requirements.
  - The size memory requirement of a buffer or image is never greater than that of another buffer or image created with a greater or equal size.
  - Push constants do not have to be initialized before they are dynamically accessed.
  - The interface matching rules allow a larger output vector to match with a smaller input vector, with additional values being discarded.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceMaintenance4Features-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_MAINTENANCE_4_FEATURES`
