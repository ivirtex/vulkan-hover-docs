## Name

VkPipelineExecutablePropertiesKHR - Structure describing a pipeline executable



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPipelineExecutablePropertiesKHR` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties
typedef struct VkPipelineExecutablePropertiesKHR {
    VkStructureType       sType;
    void*                 pNext;
    VkShaderStageFlags    stages;
    char                  name[VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE];
    char                  description[VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE];
    uint32_t              subgroupSize;
} VkPipelineExecutablePropertiesKHR;
```

## [](#_members)Members

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- `stages` is a bitmask of zero or more [VkShaderStageFlagBits](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkShaderStageFlagBits.html) indicating which shader stages (if any) were principally used as inputs to compile this pipeline executable.
- `name` is an array of `VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE` `char` containing a null-terminated UTF-8 string which is a short human readable name for this pipeline executable.
- `description` is an array of `VK_MAX_DESCRIPTION_SIZE` `char` containing a null-terminated UTF-8 string which is a human readable description for this pipeline executable.
- `subgroupSize` is the subgroup size with which this pipeline executable is dispatched.

## [](#_description)Description

Not all implementations have a 1:1 mapping between shader stages and pipeline executables and some implementations **may** reduce a given shader stage to fixed function hardware programming such that no pipeline executable is available. No guarantees are provided about the mapping between shader stages and pipeline executables and `stages` **should** be considered a best effort hint. Because the application **cannot** rely on the `stages` field to provide an exact description, `name` and `description` provide a human readable name and description which more accurately describes the given pipeline executable.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPipelineExecutablePropertiesKHR-sType-sType)VUID-VkPipelineExecutablePropertiesKHR-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_EXECUTABLE_PROPERTIES_KHR`
- [](#VUID-VkPipelineExecutablePropertiesKHR-pNext-pNext)VUID-VkPipelineExecutablePropertiesKHR-pNext-pNext  
  `pNext` **must** be `NULL`
