## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 - Structure describing the fine-grained features that can be supported by an implementation



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_1
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 {
    VkStructureType             sType;
    void*                       pNext;
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures    features;
} VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2;
```

or the equivalent

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2
typedef VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2KHR;
```

## [](#_members)Members

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- `features` is a [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures.html) structure describing the fine-grained features of the Vulkan 1.0 API.

## [](#_description)Description

The `pNext` chain of this structure is used to extend the structure with features defined by extensions. This structure **can** be used in [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) or **can** be included in the `pNext` chain of a [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) structure, in which case it controls which features are enabled in lieu of `pEnabledFeatures`.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_FEATURES_2`
