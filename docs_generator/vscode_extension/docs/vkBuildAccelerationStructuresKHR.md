## Name

vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR - Build an acceleration structure on the host



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

To build acceleration structures on the host, call:

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_acceleration_structure
VkResult vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR(
    VkDevice                                    device,
    VkDeferredOperationKHR                      deferredOperation,
    uint32_t                                    infoCount,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR* pInfos,
    const VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR* const* ppBuildRangeInfos);
```

## [](#_parameters)Parameters

- `device` is the `VkDevice` for which the acceleration structures are being built.
- `deferredOperation` is an optional [VkDeferredOperationKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeferredOperationKHR.html) to [request deferral](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#deferred-host-operations-requesting) for this command.
- `infoCount` is the number of acceleration structures to build. It specifies the number of the `pInfos` structures and `ppBuildRangeInfos` pointers that **must** be provided.
- `pInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount` [VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR.html) structures defining the geometry used to build each acceleration structure.
- `ppBuildRangeInfos` is a pointer to an array of `infoCount` pointers to arrays of [VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR.html) structures. Each `ppBuildRangeInfos`\[i] is a pointer to an array of `pInfos`\[i].`geometryCount` [VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR.html) structures defining dynamic offsets to the addresses where geometry data is stored, as defined by `pInfos`\[i].

## [](#_description)Description

This command fulfills the same task as [vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR.html) but is executed by the host.

The `vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR` command provides the ability to initiate multiple acceleration structures builds, however there is no ordering or synchronization implied between any of the individual acceleration structure builds.

Note

This means that an application **cannot** build a top-level acceleration structure in the same [vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR.html) call as the associated bottom-level or instance acceleration structures are being built. There also **cannot** be any memory aliasing between any acceleration structure memories or scratch memories being used by any of the builds.
