## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_BIT` specifies that the created pipeline will not be optimized. Using this flag **may** reduce the time taken to create the pipeline.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT` specifies that the pipeline to be created is allowed to be the parent of a pipeline that will be created in a subsequent pipeline creation call.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT` specifies that the pipeline to be created will be a child of a previously created parent pipeline.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_VIEW_INDEX_FROM_DEVICE_INDEX_BIT` specifies that any shader input variables decorated as `ViewIndex` will be assigned values as if they were decorated as `DeviceIndex`.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DISPATCH_BASE_BIT` specifies that a compute pipeline **can** be used with [vkCmdDispatchBase](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCmdDispatchBase.html) with a non-zero base workgroup.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DEFER_COMPILE_BIT_NV` specifies that a pipeline is created with all shaders in the deferred state. Before using the pipeline the application **must** call [vkCompileDeferredNV](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCompileDeferredNV.html) exactly once on each shader in the pipeline before using the pipeline.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_CAPTURE_STATISTICS_BIT_KHR` specifies that the shader compiler should capture statistics for the pipeline executables produced by the compile process which **can** later be retrieved by calling [vkGetPipelineExecutableStatisticsKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPipelineExecutableStatisticsKHR.html). Enabling this flag **must** not affect the final compiled pipeline but **may** disable pipeline caching or otherwise affect pipeline creation time.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_CAPTURE_INTERNAL_REPRESENTATIONS_BIT_KHR` specifies that the shader compiler should capture the internal representations of pipeline executables produced by the compile process which **can** later be retrieved by calling [vkGetPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationsKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPipelineExecutableInternalRepresentationsKHR.html). Enabling this flag **must** not affect the final compiled pipeline but **may** disable pipeline caching or otherwise affect pipeline creation time. When capturing IR from pipelines created with pipeline libraries, there is no guarantee that IR from libraries **can** be retrieved from the linked pipeline. Applications **should** retrieve IR from each library, and any linked pipelines, separately.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LIBRARY_BIT_KHR` specifies that the pipeline **cannot** be used directly, and instead defines a *pipeline library* that **can** be combined with other pipelines using the [VkPipelineLibraryCreateInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPipelineLibraryCreateInfoKHR.html) structure. This is available in ray tracing and graphics pipelines.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_NO_NULL_ANY_HIT_SHADERS_BIT_KHR` specifies that an any-hit shader will always be present when an any-hit shader would be executed. A NULL any-hit shader is an any-hit shader which is effectively `VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR`, such as from a shader group consisting entirely of zeros.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_NO_NULL_CLOSEST_HIT_SHADERS_BIT_KHR` specifies that a closest hit shader will always be present when a closest hit shader would be executed. A NULL closest hit shader is a closest hit shader which is effectively `VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR`, such as from a shader group consisting entirely of zeros.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_NO_NULL_MISS_SHADERS_BIT_KHR` specifies that a miss shader will always be present when a miss shader would be executed. A NULL miss shader is a miss shader which is effectively `VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR`, such as from a shader group consisting entirely of zeros.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_NO_NULL_INTERSECTION_SHADERS_BIT_KHR` specifies that an intersection shader will always be present when an intersection shader would be executed. A NULL intersection shader is an intersection shader which is effectively `VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR`, such as from a shader group consisting entirely of zeros.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_SKIP_TRIANGLES_BIT_KHR` specifies that sphere, LSS and triangle primitives will be skipped during traversal using [pipeline trace ray](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#glossary-pipeline-trace-ray) instructions.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_SKIP_AABBS_BIT_KHR` specifies that AABB primitives will be skipped during traversal using [pipeline trace ray](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#glossary-pipeline-trace-ray) instructions.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_GROUP_HANDLE_CAPTURE_REPLAY_BIT_KHR` specifies that the shader group handles **can** be saved and reused on a subsequent run (e.g. for trace capture and replay).
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_INDIRECT_BINDABLE_BIT_NV` specifies that the pipeline **can** be used in combination with [https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#device-generated-commands](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#device-generated-commands).
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_FAIL_ON_PIPELINE_COMPILE_REQUIRED_BIT` specifies that pipeline creation will fail if a compile is required for creation of a valid [VkPipeline](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPipeline.html) object; `VK_PIPELINE_COMPILE_REQUIRED` will be returned by pipeline creation, and the [VkPipeline](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPipeline.html) will be [VK\_NULL\_HANDLE](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_NULL_HANDLE.html).
- When creating multiple pipelines, `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_EARLY_RETURN_ON_FAILURE_BIT` specifies that control will be returned to the application if any individual pipeline returns a result which is not `VK_SUCCESS` rather than continuing to create additional pipelines.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_ALLOW_MOTION_BIT_NV` specifies that the pipeline is allowed to use `OpTraceRayMotionNV`.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RENDERING_FRAGMENT_SHADING_RATE_ATTACHMENT_BIT_KHR` specifies that the pipeline will be used with a fragment shading rate attachment and dynamic rendering.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RENDERING_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_MAP_ATTACHMENT_BIT_EXT` specifies that the pipeline will be used with a fragment density map attachment and dynamic rendering.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION_BIT_EXT` specifies that pipeline libraries being linked into this library **should** have link time optimizations applied. If this bit is omitted, implementations **should** instead perform linking as rapidly as possible.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RETAIN_LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION_INFO_BIT_EXT` specifies that pipeline libraries should retain any information necessary to later perform an optimal link with `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION_BIT_EXT`.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DESCRIPTOR_BUFFER_BIT_EXT` specifies that a pipeline will be used with [descriptor buffers](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#descriptorbuffers), rather than [descriptor sets](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#descriptorsets).
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_BIT_EXT` specifies that the pipeline **may** be used with an attachment [feedback loop](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#renderpass-feedbackloop) including color attachments. It is ignored if `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_ENABLE_EXT` is set in `pDynamicStates`.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_BIT_EXT` specifies that the pipeline **may** be used with an attachment [feedback loop](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#renderpass-feedbackloop) including depth-stencil attachments. It is ignored if `VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_ENABLE_EXT` is set in `pDynamicStates`.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_OPACITY_MICROMAP_BIT_EXT` specifies that the ray tracing pipeline **can** be used with acceleration structures which reference an opacity micromap array.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_RAY_TRACING_DISPLACEMENT_MICROMAP_BIT_NV` specifies that the ray tracing pipeline **can** be used with acceleration structures which reference a displacement micromap array.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_NO_PROTECTED_ACCESS_BIT` specifies that the pipeline **must** not be bound to a protected command buffer.
- `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_PROTECTED_ACCESS_ONLY_BIT` specifies that the pipeline **must** not be bound to an unprotected command buffer.

It is valid to set both `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES_BIT` and `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_DERIVATIVE_BIT`. This allows a pipeline to be both a parent and possibly a child in a pipeline hierarchy. See [Pipeline Derivatives](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-pipeline-derivatives) for more information.

When an implementation is looking up a pipeline in a [pipeline cache](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-cache), if that pipeline is being created using linked libraries, implementations **should** always return an equivalent pipeline created with `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION_BIT_EXT` if available, whether or not that bit was specified.

Note

Using `VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION_BIT_EXT` (or not) when linking pipeline libraries is intended as a performance tradeoff between host and device. If the bit is omitted, linking should be faster and produce a pipeline more rapidly, but performance of the pipeline on the target device may be reduced. If the bit is included, linking may be slower but should produce a pipeline with device performance comparable to a monolithically created pipeline. Using both options can allow latency-sensitive applications to generate a suboptimal but usable pipeline quickly, and then perform an optimal link in the background, substituting the result for the suboptimally linked pipeline as soon as it is available.
