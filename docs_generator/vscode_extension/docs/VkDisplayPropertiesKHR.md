## Name

VkDisplayPropertiesKHR - Structure describing an available display device



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkDisplayPropertiesKHR` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_display
typedef struct VkDisplayPropertiesKHR {
    VkDisplayKHR                  display;
    const char*                   displayName;
    VkExtent2D                    physicalDimensions;
    VkExtent2D                    physicalResolution;
    VkSurfaceTransformFlagsKHR    supportedTransforms;
    VkBool32                      planeReorderPossible;
    VkBool32                      persistentContent;
} VkDisplayPropertiesKHR;
```

## [](#_members)Members

- `display` is a handle that is used to refer to the display described here. This handle will be valid for the lifetime of the Vulkan instance.
- `displayName` is `NULL` or a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string containing the name of the display. Generally, this will be the name provided by the displayâ€™s EDID. If `NULL`, no suitable name is available. If not `NULL`, the string pointed to **must** remain accessible and unmodified as long as `display` is valid.
- `physicalDimensions` describes the physical width and height of the visible portion of the display, in millimeters.
- `physicalResolution` describes the physical, native, or preferred resolution of the display.

## [](#_description)Description

Note

For devices which have no natural value to return here, implementations **should** return the maximum resolution supported.

- `supportedTransforms` is a bitmask of [VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR.html) describing which transforms are supported by this display.
- `planeReorderPossible` tells whether the planes on this display **can** have their z order changed. If this is `VK_TRUE`, the application **can** re-arrange the planes on this display in any order relative to each other.
- `persistentContent` tells whether the display supports self-refresh/internal buffering. If this is true, the application **can** submit persistent present operations on swapchains created against this display.

Note

Persistent presents **may** have higher latency, and **may** use less power when the screen content is updated infrequently, or when only a portion of the screen needs to be updated in most frames.
