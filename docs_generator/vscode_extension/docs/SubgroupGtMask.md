# SubgroupGtMask(3) Manual Page

## Name

SubgroupGtMask - Mask of shader invocations in a subgroup with a higher subgroup local invocation ID



## [](#_description)Description

`SubgroupGtMask`

Decorating a variable with the `SubgroupGtMask` builtin decoration will make that variable contain the *subgroup mask* of the current subgroup invocation. The bits corresponding to the invocations greater than `SubgroupLocalInvocationId` through `SubgroupSize`-1 are set in the variable decorated with `SubgroupGtMask`. All other bits are set to zero.

`SubgroupGtMaskKHR` is an alias of `SubgroupGtMask`.

Valid Usage

- [](#VUID-SubgroupGtMask-SubgroupGtMask-04374)VUID-SubgroupGtMask-SubgroupGtMask-04374  
  The variable decorated with `SubgroupGtMask` **must** be declared using the `Input` `Storage` `Class`
- [](#VUID-SubgroupGtMask-SubgroupGtMask-04375)VUID-SubgroupGtMask-SubgroupGtMask-04375  
  The variable decorated with `SubgroupGtMask` **must** be declared as a four-component vector of 32-bit integer values
