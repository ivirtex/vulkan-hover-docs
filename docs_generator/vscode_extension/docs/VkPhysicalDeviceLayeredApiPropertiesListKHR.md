## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesListKHR - Structure describing layered implementations underneath the Vulkan physical device



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesListKHR` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_maintenance7
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesListKHR {
    VkStructureType                             sType;
    void*                                       pNext;
    uint32_t                                    layeredApiCount;
    VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesKHR*    pLayeredApis;
} VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesListKHR;
```

## [](#_members)Members

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- `layeredApiCount` is an integer related to the number of layered implementations underneath the Vulkan physical device, as described below.
- `pLayeredApis` is a pointer to an array of [VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesKHR.html) in which information regarding the layered implementations underneath the Vulkan physical device are returned.

## [](#_description)Description

If `pLayeredApis` is `NULL`, then the number of layered implementations that are underneath the top-most Vulkan physical device (i.e. the one returned by [vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2.html)) is returned in `layeredApiCount`. Otherwise, `layeredApiCount` **must** be set by the application to the number of elements in the `pLayeredApis` array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of values actually written to `pLayeredApis`. If the value of `layeredApiCount` is less than the number of layered implementations underneath the Vulkan physical device, at most `layeredApiCount` values will be written to `pLayeredApis`. An implementation that is not a layer will return 0 in `layeredApiCount`.

In the presence of multiple layered implementations, each element of `pLayeredApis` corresponds to an API implementation that is implemented on top of the API at the previous index. If there are layered implementations underneath a non-Vulkan implementation, they may not be visible in this query as the corresponding APIs may lack such a query.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesListKHR` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2.html), it is filled in with each corresponding implementation-dependent property.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesListKHR-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesListKHR-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_LAYERED_API_PROPERTIES_LIST_KHR`
- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesListKHR-pLayeredApis-parameter)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesListKHR-pLayeredApis-parameter  
  If `layeredApiCount` is not `0`, and `pLayeredApis` is not `NULL`, `pLayeredApis` **must** be a valid pointer to an array of `layeredApiCount` [VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceLayeredApiPropertiesKHR.html) structures
