## [](#_description)Description

This is extension, along with related platform extensions, allows applications to take exclusive control of displays associated with a native windowing system. This is especially useful for virtual reality applications that wish to hide HMDs (head mounted displays) from the native platformâ€™s display management system, desktop, and/or other applications.

## [](#_issues)Issues

1\) Should this extension and its related platform-specific extensions leverage `VK_KHR_display`, or provide separate equivalent interfaces.

**RESOLVED**: Use `VK_KHR_display` concepts and objects. `VK_KHR_display` can be used to enumerate all displays on the system, including those attached to/in use by a window system or native platform, but `VK_KHR_display_swapchain` will fail to create a swapchain on in-use displays. This extension and its platform-specific children will allow applications to grab in-use displays away from window systems and/or native platforms, allowing them to be used with `VK_KHR_display_swapchain`.

2\) Are separate calls needed to acquire displays and enable direct mode?

**RESOLVED**: No, these operations happen in one combined command. Acquiring a display puts it into direct mode.
