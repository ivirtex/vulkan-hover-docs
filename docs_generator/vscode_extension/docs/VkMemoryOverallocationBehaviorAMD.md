# VkMemoryOverallocationBehaviorAMD(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkMemoryOverallocationBehaviorAMD - Specify memory overallocation behavior



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

Possible values for [VkDeviceMemoryOverallocationCreateInfoAMD](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceMemoryOverallocationCreateInfoAMD.html)::`overallocationBehavior` include:

```c++
// Provided by VK_AMD_memory_overallocation_behavior
typedef enum VkMemoryOverallocationBehaviorAMD {
    VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_DEFAULT_AMD = 0,
    VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_ALLOWED_AMD = 1,
    VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_DISALLOWED_AMD = 2,
} VkMemoryOverallocationBehaviorAMD;
```

## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_DEFAULT_AMD` lets the implementation decide if overallocation is allowed.
- `VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_ALLOWED_AMD` specifies overallocation is allowed if platform permits.
- `VK_MEMORY_OVERALLOCATION_BEHAVIOR_DISALLOWED_AMD` specifies the application is not allowed to allocate device memory beyond the heap sizes reported by [VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.html). Allocations that are not explicitly made by the application within the scope of the Vulkan instance are not accounted for.
