## Name

VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features - Structure describing the Vulkan 1.1 features that can be supported by an implementation



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_2
typedef struct VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features {
    VkStructureType    sType;
    void*              pNext;
    VkBool32           storageBuffer16BitAccess;
    VkBool32           uniformAndStorageBuffer16BitAccess;
    VkBool32           storagePushConstant16;
    VkBool32           storageInputOutput16;
    VkBool32           multiview;
    VkBool32           multiviewGeometryShader;
    VkBool32           multiviewTessellationShader;
    VkBool32           variablePointersStorageBuffer;
    VkBool32           variablePointers;
    VkBool32           protectedMemory;
    VkBool32           samplerYcbcrConversion;
    VkBool32           shaderDrawParameters;
} VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features;
```

## [](#_members)Members

This structure describes the following features:

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.

## [](#_description)Description

- []()`storageBuffer16BitAccess` specifies whether objects in the `StorageBuffer`, `ShaderRecordBufferKHR`, or `PhysicalStorageBuffer` storage class with the `Block` decoration **can** have 16-bit integer and 16-bit floating-point members. If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or 16-bit floating-point members **must** not be used in such objects. This also specifies whether shader modules **can** declare the `StorageBuffer16BitAccess` capability.
- []()`uniformAndStorageBuffer16BitAccess` specifies whether objects in the `Uniform` storage class with the `Block` decoration **can** have 16-bit integer and 16-bit floating-point members. If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or 16-bit floating-point members **must** not be used in such objects. This also specifies whether shader modules **can** declare the `UniformAndStorageBuffer16BitAccess` capability.
- []()`storagePushConstant16` specifies whether objects in the `PushConstant` storage class **can** have 16-bit integer and 16-bit floating-point members. If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or floating-point members **must** not be used in such objects. This also specifies whether shader modules **can** declare the `StoragePushConstant16` capability.
- []()`storageInputOutput16` specifies whether objects in the `Input` and `Output` storage classes **can** have 16-bit integer and 16-bit floating-point members. If this feature is not enabled, 16-bit integer or 16-bit floating-point members **must** not be used in such objects. This also specifies whether shader modules **can** declare the `StorageInputOutput16` capability.
- []()`multiview` specifies whether the implementation supports multiview rendering within a render pass. If this feature is not enabled, the view mask of each subpass **must** always be zero.
- []()`multiviewGeometryShader` specifies whether the implementation supports multiview rendering within a render pass, with [geometry shaders](#geometry). If this feature is not enabled, then a pipeline compiled against a subpass with a non-zero view mask **must** not include a geometry shader.
- []()`multiviewTessellationShader` specifies whether the implementation supports multiview rendering within a render pass, with [tessellation shaders](#tessellation). If this feature is not enabled, then a pipeline compiled against a subpass with a non-zero view mask **must** not include any tessellation shaders.
- []()`variablePointersStorageBuffer` specifies whether the implementation supports the SPIR-V `VariablePointersStorageBuffer` capability. When this feature is not enabled, shader modules **must** not declare the `SPV_KHR_variable_pointers` extension or the `VariablePointersStorageBuffer` capability.
- []()`variablePointers` specifies whether the implementation supports the SPIR-V `VariablePointers` capability. When this feature is not enabled, shader modules **must** not declare the `VariablePointers` capability.
- []()`protectedMemory` specifies whether [protected memory](#memory-protected-memory) is supported.
- []()`samplerYcbcrConversion` specifies whether the implementation supports [sampler Y′CBCR conversion](#samplers-YCbCr-conversion). If `samplerYcbcrConversion` is `VK_FALSE`, sampler Y′CBCR conversion is not supported, and samplers using sampler Y′CBCR conversion **must** not be used.
- []()`shaderDrawParameters` specifies whether the implementation supports the SPIR-V `DrawParameters` capability. When this feature is not enabled, shader modules **must** not declare the `SPV_KHR_shader_draw_parameters` extension or the `DrawParameters` capability.

If the `VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features` structure is included in the `pNext` chain of the [VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html) structure passed to [vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2.html), it is filled in to indicate whether each corresponding feature is supported. If the application wishes to use a [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html) with any features described by `VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features`, it **must** add an instance of the structure, with the desired feature members set to `VK_TRUE`, to the `pNext` chain of [VkDeviceCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html) when creating the [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html).

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features-sType-sType)VUID-VkPhysicalDeviceVulkan11Features-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_VULKAN_1_1_FEATURES`
