## [](#_description)Description

This extension allows an application to source the number of draws for indirect drawing commands from a buffer. This enables applications to generate an arbitrary number of drawing commands and execute them without host intervention.

## [](#_promotion_to_vk_khr_draw_indirect_count)Promotion to `VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count`

All functionality in this extension is included in `VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count`, with the suffix changed to KHR. The original type, enum, and command names are still available as aliases of the core functionality.
