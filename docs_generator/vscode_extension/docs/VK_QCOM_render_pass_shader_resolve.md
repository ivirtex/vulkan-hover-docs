## [](#_description)Description

This extension allows a shader resolve to replace fixed-function resolve.

Fixed-function resolve is limited in function to simple filters of multisample buffers to a single sample buffer.

Fixed-function resolve is more performance efficient and/or power efficient than shader resolve for such simple filters.

Shader resolve allows a shader writer to create complex, non-linear filtering of a multisample buffer in the last subpass of a subpass dependency chain.

This extension also provides a bit which **can** be used to enlarge a sample region dependency to a fragment region dependency, so that a framebuffer-region dependency **can** replace a framebuffer-global dependency in some cases.

## [](#_issues)Issues

1\) Should this extension be named render\_pass\_shader\_resolve?

**RESOLVED** Yes.

This is part of suite of small extensions to render pass.

Following the style guide, instead of following VK\_KHR\_create\_renderpass2.

2\) Should the VK\_SAMPLE\_COUNT\_1\_BIT be required for each pColorAttachment and the DepthStencilAttachent?

**RESOLVED** No.

While this may not be a common use case, and while most fixed-function resolve hardware has this limitation, there is little reason to require a shader resolve to resolve to a single sample buffer.

3\) Should a shader resolve subpass be the last subpass in a render pass?

**RESOLVED** Yes.

To be more specific, it should be the last subpass in a subpass dependency chain.

4\) Do we need the `VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_FRAGMENT_REGION_BIT_QCOM` bit?

**RESOLVED** Yes.

This applies when an input attachmentâ€™s sample count is equal to `rasterizationSamples`. Further, if `sampleShading` is enabled (explicitly or implicitly) then `minSampleShading` **must** equal 0.0.

However, this bit may be set on any subpass, it is not restricted to a shader resolve subpass.
