## Name

VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateFlagBits - Bitmask specifying additional depth/stencil state information.



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

Bits which **can** be set in the [VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo.html)::`flags` parameter are:

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access
typedef enum VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateFlagBits {
  // Provided by VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT = 0x00000001,
  // Provided by VK_EXT_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_EXT = 0x00000002,
  // Provided by VK_ARM_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_ARM = VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT,
  // Provided by VK_ARM_rasterization_order_attachment_access
    VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_ARM = VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_EXT,
} VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateFlagBits;
```

## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT` specifies that access to the depth aspects of depth/stencil and input attachments will have implicit framebuffer-local memory dependencies.
- `VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_EXT` specifies that access to the stencil aspects of depth/stencil and input attachments will have implicit framebuffer-local memory dependencies.

When `VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_ACCESS_BIT_EXT` is included in a pipeline, it forms a framebuffer-local memory dependency for each fragment generated by draw commands for that pipeline with the following scopes:

- The first [synchronization scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) includes `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT` and `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT` pipeline stages executed by all previous fragments (as defined by [primitive order](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#drawing-primitive-order)) in the corresponding [framebuffer regions](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-framebuffer-regions) including those generated by the same draw command.
- The second [synchronization scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) includes `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT` stage executed by the generated fragment.
- The first [access scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) includes all writes to the depth aspect of depth/stencil attachments.
- The second [access scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) includes all reads from the depth aspect of input attachments.

When `VK_PIPELINE_DEPTH_STENCIL_STATE_CREATE_RASTERIZATION_ORDER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_ACCESS_BIT_EXT` is included in a pipeline, it forms a framebuffer-local memory dependency for each fragment generated by draw commands for that pipeline with the following scopes:

- The first [synchronization scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) includes `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT` `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT` pipeline stages executed by all previous fragments (as defined by [primitive order](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#drawing-primitive-order)) in the corresponding [framebuffer regions](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-framebuffer-regions) including those generated by the same draw command.
- The second [synchronization scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) includes `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_SHADER_BIT` and `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT` pipeline stages executed by the generated fragment.
- The first [access scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) includes all writes to the stencil aspect of depth/stencil attachments.
- The second [access scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) includes all reads from the stencil aspect of input attachments.
