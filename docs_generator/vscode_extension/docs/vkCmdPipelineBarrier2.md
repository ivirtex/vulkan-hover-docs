## Name

vkCmdPipelineBarrier2 - Insert a memory dependency



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

To record a pipeline barrier, call:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
void vkCmdPipelineBarrier2(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkDependencyInfo*                     pDependencyInfo);
```

or the equivalent command

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_synchronization2
void vkCmdPipelineBarrier2KHR(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    const VkDependencyInfo*                     pDependencyInfo);
```

## [](#_parameters)Parameters

- `commandBuffer` is the command buffer into which the command is recorded.
- `pDependencyInfo` is a pointer to a [VkDependencyInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDependencyInfo.html) structure defining the scopes of this operation.

## [](#_description)Description

When [vkCmdPipelineBarrier2](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCmdPipelineBarrier2.html) is submitted to a queue, it defines memory dependencies between commands that were submitted to the same queue before it, and those submitted to the same queue after it.

The first [synchronization scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and [access scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of each memory dependency defined by `pDependencyInfo` are applied to operations that occurred earlier in [submission order](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-submission-order).

The second [synchronization scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-scopes) and [access scope](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-dependencies-access-scopes) of each memory dependency defined by `pDependencyInfo` are applied to operations that occurred later in [submission order](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#synchronization-submission-order).

If `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` is recorded within a render pass instance, the synchronization scopes are limited to a subset of operations within the same subpass or render pass instance.
