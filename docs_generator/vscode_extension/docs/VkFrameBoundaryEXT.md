## Name

VkFrameBoundaryEXT - Add frame boundary information to queue submissions



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

The `VkFrameBoundaryEXT` structure is defined as:

```c++
// Provided by VK_EXT_frame_boundary
typedef struct VkFrameBoundaryEXT {
    VkStructureType            sType;
    const void*                pNext;
    VkFrameBoundaryFlagsEXT    flags;
    uint64_t                   frameID;
    uint32_t                   imageCount;
    const VkImage*             pImages;
    uint32_t                   bufferCount;
    const VkBuffer*            pBuffers;
    uint64_t                   tagName;
    size_t                     tagSize;
    const void*                pTag;
} VkFrameBoundaryEXT;
```

## [](#_members)Members

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- `flags` is a bitmask of [VkFrameBoundaryFlagBitsEXT](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkFrameBoundaryFlagBitsEXT.html) that can flag the last submission of a frame identifier.
- `frameID` is the frame identifier.
- `imageCount` is the number of images that store frame results.
- `pImages` is a pointer to an array of VkImage objects with imageCount entries.
- `bufferCount` is the number of buffers the store the frame results.
- `pBuffers` is a pointer to an array of VkBuffer objects with bufferCount entries.
- `tagName` is a numerical identifier for tag data.
- `tagSize` is the number of bytes of tag data.
- `pTag` is a pointer to an array of `tagSize` bytes containing tag data.

## [](#_description)Description

The application **can** associate frame boundary information to a queue submission call by adding a `VkFrameBoundaryEXT` structure to the `pNext` chain of [queue submission](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#devsandqueues-submission), [VkPresentInfoKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPresentInfoKHR.html), or [VkBindSparseInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkBindSparseInfo.html).

Note

The frame identifier is used to associate one or more queue submissions to a frame. It is meant to be unique within a frame lifetime, i.e. it is possible (though not recommended) to reuse frame identifiers, as long as any two frames that may have overlapping queue submissions (as in the example above) use different frame identifiers.

Since the concept of frame is application-dependent, there is no way to validate the use of frame identifier. It is good practice to use a monotonically increasing counter as the frame identifier and not reuse identifiers between frames.

The `pImages` and `pBuffers` arrays contain a list of images and buffers which store the "end result" of the frame. As the concept of frame is application-dependent, not all frames **may** produce their results in images or buffers, yet this is a sufficiently common case to be handled by `VkFrameBoundaryEXT`. Note that no extra information, such as image layout is being provided, since the images are meant to be used by tools which would already be tracking this required information. Having the possibility of passing a list of end-result images makes `VkFrameBoundaryEXT` as expressive as [vkQueuePresentKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkQueuePresentKHR.html), which is often the default frame boundary delimiter.

The application **can** also associate arbitrary extra information via tag data using `tagName`, `tagSize` and `pTag`. This extra information is typically tool-specific.

Valid Usage (Implicit)

- [](#VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-sType-sType)VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-sType-sType  
  `sType` **must** be `VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FRAME_BOUNDARY_EXT`
- [](#VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-flags-parameter)VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-flags-parameter  
  `flags` **must** be a valid combination of [VkFrameBoundaryFlagBitsEXT](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkFrameBoundaryFlagBitsEXT.html) values
- [](#VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-pImages-parameter)VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-pImages-parameter  
  If `imageCount` is not `0`, and `pImages` is not `NULL`, `pImages` **must** be a valid pointer to an array of `imageCount` valid [VkImage](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkImage.html) handles
- [](#VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-pBuffers-parameter)VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-pBuffers-parameter  
  If `bufferCount` is not `0`, and `pBuffers` is not `NULL`, `pBuffers` **must** be a valid pointer to an array of `bufferCount` valid [VkBuffer](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkBuffer.html) handles
- [](#VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-pTag-parameter)VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-pTag-parameter  
  If `tagSize` is not `0`, and `pTag` is not `NULL`, `pTag` **must** be a valid pointer to an array of `tagSize` bytes
- [](#VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-commonparent)VUID-VkFrameBoundaryEXT-commonparent  
  Both of the elements of `pBuffers`, and the elements of `pImages` that are valid handles of non-ignored parameters **must** have been created, allocated, or retrieved from the same [VkDevice](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDevice.html)
