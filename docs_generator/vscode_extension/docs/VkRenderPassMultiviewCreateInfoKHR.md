## Name

VkRenderPassMultiviewCreateInfo - Structure containing multiview information for all subpasses



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

If the [VkRenderPassCreateInfo](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkRenderPassCreateInfo.html)::`pNext` chain includes a `VkRenderPassMultiviewCreateInfo` structure, then that structure includes an array of view masks, view offsets, and correlation masks for the render pass.

The `VkRenderPassMultiviewCreateInfo` structure is defined as:

This functionality is deprecated by [Vulkan Version 1.2](#versions-1.2). See [Deprecated Functionality](#deprecation-renderpass2) for more information.

## [](#_members)Members

- `sType` is a [VkStructureType](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkStructureType.html) value identifying this structure.
- `pNext` is `NULL` or a pointer to a structure extending this structure.
- `subpassCount` is zero or the number of subpasses in the render pass.
- `pViewMasks` is a pointer to an array of `subpassCount` view masks, where each mask is a bitfield of view indices describing which views rendering is broadcast to in each subpass, when multiview is enabled. If `subpassCount` is zero, each view mask is treated as zero.
- `dependencyCount` is zero or the number of dependencies in the render pass.
- `pViewOffsets` is a pointer to an array of `dependencyCount` view offsets, one for each dependency. If `dependencyCount` is zero, each dependencyâ€™s view offset is treated as zero. Each view offset controls which views in the source subpass the views in the destination subpass depend on.
- `correlationMaskCount` is zero or the number of correlation masks.
- `pCorrelationMasks` is a pointer to an array of `correlationMaskCount` view masks indicating sets of views that **may** be more efficient to render concurrently.

## [](#_description)Description

When a subpass uses a non-zero view mask, *multiview* functionality is considered to be enabled. Multiview is all-or-nothing for a render pass - that is, either all subpasses **must** have a non-zero view mask (though some subpasses **may** have only one view) or all **must** be zero. Multiview causes all drawing and clear commands in the subpass to behave as if they were broadcast to each view, where a view is represented by one layer of the framebuffer attachments. All draws and clears are broadcast to each *view index* whose bit is set in the view mask. The view index is provided in the `ViewIndex` shader input variable, and color, depth/stencil, and input attachments all read/write the layer of the framebuffer corresponding to the view index.

If the view mask is zero for all subpasses, multiview is considered to be disabled and all drawing commands execute normally, without this additional broadcasting.

Some implementations **may** not support multiview in conjunction with [mesh shaders](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-multiviewMeshShader), [geometry shaders](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-multiview-gs) or [tessellation shaders](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#features-multiview-tess).

When multiview is enabled, the `VK_DEPENDENCY_VIEW_LOCAL_BIT` bit in a dependency **can** be used to express a view-local dependency, meaning that each view in the destination subpass depends on a single view in the source subpass. Unlike pipeline barriers, a subpass dependency **can** potentially have a different view mask in the source subpass and the destination subpass. If the dependency is view-local, then each view (dstView) in the destination subpass depends on the view dstView + `pViewOffsets`\[dependency] in the source subpass. If there is not such a view in the source subpass, then this dependency does not affect that view in the destination subpass. If the dependency is not view-local, then all views in the destination subpass depend on all views in the source subpass, and the view offset is ignored. A non-zero view offset is not allowed in a self-dependency.

The elements of `pCorrelationMasks` are a set of masks of views indicating that views in the same mask **may** exhibit spatial coherency between the views, making it more efficient to render them concurrently. Correlation masks **must** not have a functional effect on the results of the multiview rendering.

When multiview is enabled, at the beginning of each subpass all non-render pass state is undefined. In particular, each time [vkCmdBeginRenderPass](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCmdBeginRenderPass.html) or [vkCmdNextSubpass](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/vkCmdNextSubpass.html) is called the graphics pipeline **must** be bound, any relevant descriptor sets or vertex/index buffers **must** be bound, and any relevant dynamic state or push constants **must** be set before they are used.

A multiview subpass **can** declare that its shaders will write per-view attributes for all views in a single invocation, by setting the `VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_PER_VIEW_ATTRIBUTES_BIT_NVX` bit in the subpass description. The only supported per-view attributes are position and viewport mask, and per-view position and viewport masks are written to output array variables decorated with `PositionPerViewNV` and `ViewportMaskPerViewNV`, respectively. If the `VK_NV_viewport_array2` extension is not supported and enabled, `ViewportMaskPerViewNV` **must** not be used. Values written to elements of `PositionPerViewNV` and `ViewportMaskPerViewNV` **must** not depend on the `ViewIndex`. The shader **must** also write to an output variable decorated with `Position`, and the value written to `Position` **must** equal the value written to `PositionPerViewNV`\[`ViewIndex`]. Similarly, if `ViewportMaskPerViewNV` is written to then the shader **must** also write to an output variable decorated with `ViewportMaskNV`, and the value written to `ViewportMaskNV` **must** equal the value written to `ViewportMaskPerViewNV`\[`ViewIndex`]. Implementations will either use values taken from `Position` and `ViewportMaskNV` and invoke the shader once for each view, or will use values taken from `PositionPerViewNV` and `ViewportMaskPerViewNV` and invoke the shader fewer times. The values written to `Position` and `ViewportMaskNV` **must** not depend on the values written to `PositionPerViewNV` and `ViewportMaskPerViewNV`, or vice versa (to allow compilers to eliminate the unused outputs). All attributes that do not have `*PerViewNV` counterparts **must** not depend on `ViewIndex`.

Per-view attributes are all-or-nothing for a subpass. That is, all pipelines compiled against a subpass that includes the `VK_SUBPASS_DESCRIPTION_PER_VIEW_ATTRIBUTES_BIT_NVX` bit **must** write per-view attributes to the `*PerViewNV[]` shader outputs, in addition to the non-per-view (e.g. `Position`) outputs. Pipelines compiled against a subpass that does not include this bit **must** not include the `*PerViewNV[]` outputs in their interfaces.
