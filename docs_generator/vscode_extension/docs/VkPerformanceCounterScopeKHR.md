# VkPerformanceCounterScopeKHR(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkPerformanceCounterScopeKHR - Supported counter scope types



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

Performance counters have an associated scope. This scope describes the granularity of a performance counter.

The performance counter scope types which **may** be returned in [VkPerformanceCounterKHR](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPerformanceCounterKHR.html)::`scope` are:

```c++
// Provided by VK_KHR_performance_query
typedef enum VkPerformanceCounterScopeKHR {
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_KHR = 0,
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_RENDER_PASS_KHR = 1,
    VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_COMMAND_KHR = 2,
  // VK_QUERY_SCOPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_KHR is a deprecated alias
    VK_QUERY_SCOPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_KHR = VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_KHR,
  // VK_QUERY_SCOPE_RENDER_PASS_KHR is a deprecated alias
    VK_QUERY_SCOPE_RENDER_PASS_KHR = VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_RENDER_PASS_KHR,
  // VK_QUERY_SCOPE_COMMAND_KHR is a deprecated alias
    VK_QUERY_SCOPE_COMMAND_KHR = VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_COMMAND_KHR,
} VkPerformanceCounterScopeKHR;
```

## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_KHR` - the performance counter scope is a single complete command buffer.
- `VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_RENDER_PASS_KHR` - the performance counter scope is zero or more complete render passes. The performance query containing the performance counter **must** begin and end outside a render pass instance.
- `VK_PERFORMANCE_COUNTER_SCOPE_COMMAND_KHR` - the performance counter scope is zero or more commands.
