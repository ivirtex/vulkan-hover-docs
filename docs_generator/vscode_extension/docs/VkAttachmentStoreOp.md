# VkAttachmentStoreOp(3) Manual Page

## Name

VkAttachmentStoreOp - Specify how contents of an attachment are treated at the end of the subpass where it is last used



## [](#_c_specification)C Specification

Possible values of [VkAttachmentDescription](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkAttachmentDescription.html)::`storeOp` and `stencilStoreOp`, specifying how the contents of the attachment are treated, are:

```c++
// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
typedef enum VkAttachmentStoreOp {
    VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE = 0,
    VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE = 1,
  // Provided by VK_VERSION_1_3
    VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE = 1000301000,
  // Provided by VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering, VK_KHR_load_store_op_none
    VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE_KHR = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE,
  // Provided by VK_QCOM_render_pass_store_ops
    VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE_QCOM = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE,
  // Provided by VK_EXT_load_store_op_none
    VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE_EXT = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE,
} VkAttachmentStoreOp;
```

## [](#_description)Description

- `VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE` specifies the contents generated during the render pass and within the render area are written to memory. For attachments with a depth/stencil format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`. For attachments with a color format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE` specifies the contents within the render area are not needed after rendering, and **may** be discarded; the contents of the attachment will be undefined inside the render area. For attachments with a depth/stencil format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`. For attachments with a color format, this uses the access type `VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT`.
- `VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_NONE` specifies the contents within the render area are not accessed by the store operation as long as no values are written to the attachment during the render pass. If values are written during the render pass, this behaves identically to `VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE` and with matching access semantics.

Note

`VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE` **can** cause contents generated during previous render passes to be discarded before reaching memory, even if no write to the attachment occurs during the current render pass.
