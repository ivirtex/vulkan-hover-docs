# PrimitiveShadingRateKHR(3) Manual Page

## Name

PrimitiveShadingRateKHR - Primitive contribution to fragment shading rate



## [](#_description)Description

`PrimitiveShadingRateKHR`

Decorating a variable with the `PrimitiveShadingRateKHR` built-in decoration will make that variable contain the [primitive fragment shading rate](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#primsrast-fragment-shading-rate-primitive).

The value written to the variable decorated with `PrimitiveShadingRateKHR` by the last [pre-rasterization shader stage](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) in the pipeline is used as the [primitive fragment shading rate](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#primsrast-fragment-shading-rate-primitive). Outputs in previous shader stages are ignored.

If the last active [pre-rasterization shader stage](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/html/vkspec.html#pipelines-graphics-subsets-pre-rasterization) shader entry pointâ€™s interface does not include a variable decorated with `PrimitiveShadingRateKHR`, then it is as if the shader specified a fragment shading rate value of 0, indicating a horizontal and vertical rate of 1 pixel.

If a shader has `PrimitiveShadingRateKHR` in the output interface and there is an execution path through the shader that does not write to it, its value is undefined for executions of the shader that take that path.
